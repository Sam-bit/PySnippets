Fact-check We noticed that the CCTV footage shows the date “5-11-22” i.e., the clip is at least a week-old, but we could not find any reliable news reports of such a a crime taking place in Mumbai. This showed the possibility that the date in the footage could be wrong. Then we found that speaking to the media, Mumbai Police had clarified that no such killing had taken took place in the city. This statement was also reported by Aaj Tak. While analyzing the video we noticed a couple of things that seemed unusual: When the person playing the video is asked to zoom into the ‘killer’, it takes him just a fraction of a second to do that. And the zoomed footage does not appear to be pixelated at all. It retains the same quality. 2. At 0:45-seconds, the computer operator is asked to play the dashcam footage of a car. Again, this footage is played within a fraction of a second. Alt News also noticed the word ‘Maarrich’ [a demon in the Hindu epic Ramayana] written in the viral footage in the first few seconds. Taking this clue, we performed a keyword search on Twitter and came across a tweet by one Dewang Trivedi according to whom, the viral clip is a promotional tactic for an upcoming film Maarrich. Maarrich is an upcoming film by Actor/Producer Tusshar Kapoor, the promo of which was shared by Kapoor on Twitter on September 13. According to India Today , Kapoor would be playing the role of a cop in the film. The spelling of the word ‘Maarrich’ and the bits and pieces of information available in the public domain all point towards the fact that the viral clip is possibly a promotional tactic for this film.

Alt News reached out to one of the individuals who shared the clip and later deleted it. They said on the condition of anonymity that they had posted it as part of a paid promotion. Though they could not ascertain whether it was for the film ‘Maarrich’. To summarize, in all probability, a viral CCTV footage in which a man in a black hat can be seen brutally attacking a woman is linked to the upcoming film ‘Maarrich’. The Mumbai Police has clarified that no such killing took place in the city. A 1:34-minute-long CCTV camera clip is being widely circulated on social media in which viewers can see a woman getting down from a car outside a residential complex and as the car goes away, a man in a black hat grabs her from behind and stabs her to death. He then drags her body away behind the parked cars. The clip is being shared with the claim that it is an incident from Mumbai’s Andheri, and has been given the title “#HatmanKillerInMumbai”. User @sandeepkishore_ shared the clip on Twitter with a caption in Hindi that can be translated as, “A very horrific incident came to light in a leaked CCTV footage from a locality in Andheri where a man in a black hat was seen brutally killing a woman.

https://www.altnews.in/youtube-fails-to-moderate-scripted-child-kidnapping-videos-stoking-fear-and-making-money/,YouTube fails to moderate scripted child-kidnapping videos stoking fear and making money,https://i0.wp.com/www.altnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Youtube-story_blurred.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1,2022-11-11 07:21:51,2022-11-14 13:30:45,"Trigger Warning: Violent Content. Viewer discretion is advised. Over the past few months, rumours of child kidnapping have spread like wildfire in many parts of the country based on purported...",,"Over the past few months, rumours of child kidnapping have spread like wildfire in many parts of the country based on purported videos of abductions or attempted abductions and mob assaults, viral across social media platforms. Typically, these videos contain gory visuals and a warning that some people are roaming about in a particular area to kidnap children. Back in 2018, IndiaSpend analyzed news reports from across India which said there had been ” …61 (is) number of mob attacks sparked by rumours or suspicion of child-lifting circulated on social media since the beginning of the year. So far this year, 24 persons have been killed in such mob attacks. This more than 4.5 times rise in attacks and two-fold rise in deaths of this kind over 2017, when 11 persons were killed in eight separate attacks”. The report also touched upon the fact that these attacks indicated an erosion of faith in the law enforcement system. A 2018 incident in Assam where two musicians were killed on the suspicion of being child kidnappers received global media attention . Changing Contours of Misinformation Through Videos The nature of misinformation in the context of child kidnapping has undergone some changes over the years. Initially, the viral videos were clipped from longer videos presumably made for raising awareness . Once these videos caused panic, people started attacking unfamiliar faces suspecting them to be child lifters, and the videos of those attacks were shared with the claim that they were actual child kidnappers being punished for their deeds. Subsequently, unrelated gory clips of dead bodies and mutilated corpses were shared as proof of organ trafficking. The rumour-mongering was taken to the next level when YouTube content creators started to upload scripted child-kidnapping videos. Sometimes, they were circulated in regional languages. Eventually, the public reaction to child kidnapping became topical, inspiring the content creators to monetize the rumours through targeted viewership. The economy of staged videos was explained by an Alt News report in the past. News reports have mentioned that the police have time and again appealed to the public to not fall for rumours and refrain from taking law into their hands. This report samples 20-odd scripted videos of child kidnapping and organ trafficking that have the potential to accentuate public fears on the issue, and puts them in the context of existing content moderation policy of YouTube. The objective is to draw attention to the scope and limitations of such policy and methods of moderation in the context of scripted child-kidnapping videos that are disturbing in nature. The Impact of Such Videos There have been numerous reports on the deep social impact of the scripted videos. Often, these rumours affect parents/adults because they fear for the safety of their children. Hence, such content instigates fear, suspicion and panic among people, and often results in an assault on the suspect/s. Besides, these videos create certain stereotypical impressions of who could be a child kidnapper. They are judged on the basis of how they dress and conduct themselves in public. For example, in the scripted videos, individuals are dressed as mendicants/fakirs, scrap dealers, hawkers or even vagabonds. Most of the cases of mob violence are reported from rural areas, a typical setting in the staged videos. While in many cases sadhus and mentally challenged people were at the receiving end, public officials and healthcare workers, too, were not spared. Alt News has addressed and debunked several such rumours and videos of child kidnapping in the past couple of years ( 1, 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ), and done a detailed analysis of real-life consequences of scripted or doctored videos of child abduction. It was observed that between August 30 and September 13, 2022, there were 27 attacks on individuals resulting from rumours of child abduction. There have also been several reports describing how unrelated visuals and scripted videos were passed off as real events . YouTube Policy on moderation The YouTube community guidelines outline a host of categories to address problematic content. The categories that concern us here are the policies on violent content, manipulated content , child safety and thumbnail . YouTube includes the following under violent or graphic content : Inciting others to commit violent acts against individuals or a defined group of people. Fights involving minors. Footage, audio, or imagery involving road accidents, natural disasters, war aftermath, terrorist attack aftermath, street fights, physical attacks, immolation, torture, corpses, protests or riots, robberies, medical procedures, or other such scenarios with the intent to shock or disgust viewers. Footage or imagery showing bodily fluids, such as blood or vomit, with the intent to shock or disgust viewers. Footage of corpses with massive injuries, such as severed limbs. The videos we have sampled contain unsavory, gory thumbnails as well as visuals of physical attacks, torture, corpses etc. for public consumption and presumably to pump viewership. This is in direct contravention to the guidelines on violent or graphic content policies. In most of the cases the thumbnails do not necessarily reflect the actual content in the video, thus manipulating the audience into clicking on it. These videos also fall under the category of manipulated content , described by YouTube as ‘content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm’. The child safety policy outlines conditions that could be flagged as dangerous for minors. It states, “never put minors in harmful situations that may lead to injury, including dangerous stunts, dares, or pranks”. The videos have images of children being lifted and bagged, carried away recklessly, sometimes a weapon held in close proximity to them. These ‘dangerous stunts’ clearly violate the child safety policy. The thumbnail policy lists various kinds of images that can’t be posted as thumbnails. They include Violent imagery that intends to shock or disgust Graphic or disturbing imagery with blood or gore A thumbnail that misleads viewers to think they’re about to view something that’s not in the video It is pertinent to note that YouTube monetization policy mentions that to be eligible to monetize content, the content creator has to follow the community guidelines. “Violation of our YouTube channel monetization policies may result in monetization being suspended or permanently disabled on all or any of your accounts,” the policy says. How the videos enlisted below violate the guidelines have been explained above. Here are the screenshots of some of the videos we have sampled that carry advertisements. This slideshow requires JavaScript. The Problem with Disclaimers Alt News has, in the past, documented cases of disingenuous disclaimers in the context of scripted CCTV videos. In the child-kidnapping videos disclaimers come in different forms. A few of the videos carry a written disclaimer on the screen in English for a few seconds, some in Hindi. A lot of disclaimers come towards the end of the video where the cast explains why they made the video. They claim that the content is created for the purposes of entertainment and, at times, to educate adults on the dangers posed by child traffickers. However, in all these cases, the gory clickbait images and disturbing performances like pulling out organs, slashing body etc. serve as a voyeuristic inducement to attract viewership. This makes it a matter of serious content moderation. Questions Galore The effectiveness of policy issues is intrinsically linked to the dynamics of viewership. The questions that assume significance here include — Who are the stakeholders? Who is getting affected by the consumption of these violent videos? Is it only a law enforcement issue? What is the consent system in place to create content performed by children? How does YouTube monitor which of such channels are ‘authoritative voices’? Every policy has a target audience. The nature of the videos and ground reports of public reaction to suspicions of child-kidnapping certainly show that the target audience here is parents, guardians and impressionable teens, most likely living in rural areas, where children are likely to have lesser parental surveillance. To add to the conversation on moderation, it is useful to look at it from the perspective of the rights of children. The YouTube policy guideline on children is restricted to abusive content or content that is sexual in nature. The guidelines are not exhaustive about what kind of behaviour could be deemed violent or obscene in respect of children. There is scope to create additional check gates for such videos by bringing in the question of the rights of children. Responding to some of the above queries by Alt News, a YouTube communications representative said the platform’s responsibility efforts were focused on four pillars: removing violative content , raising up authoritative content, reducing the spread of borderline content and rewarding trusted creators . More than 20,000 people around the world, including those with Indian language expertise, work to review and remove content that violates our policies, they added. They also made the point that raising authoritative information was as important for the platform as removing violative content, and improving the platform to prevent the spread of harmful misinformation was a continuous process. Recently, YouTube has flagged some gory videos involving children as inappropriate for some users. They are either unavailable or carry the warning that it is inappropriate for some users. Here are a few links to some of these videos: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 Sample Videos Most instances of child kidnapping rumours have a trend or pattern in terms of public perception. For example, the kind of people being profiled, the nature of public behaviour that would tantamount to suspicious activity, etc. The video below suggests how a child trafficker looks like. It creates the image of a person in tattered clothes or someone dealing with scraps, as a potential abductor. The disclaimer is posted at the beginning of the video and the text is in English, not necessarily the preferred language of the audience. The video was uploaded in 2019 and has garnered over 12 million views. In the the second video (below), youngsters run amok with weapons to catch abductors. The disclaimer mentions the purpose of the video is entertainment. The feature image has two scary looking men stabbing a child. How does such an image come under the purview of entertainment? The video shows a group of armed youngsters taking law into their own hands. The channel ‘The Three Bro’ has over 3,34,000 subscribers and in one year, this video has gathered over 29 million views. In the following video, the imagery is disturbing. Weapons are brandished to rip open children. There is a message in the end asking people to be wary of house guests. Such commentary is problematic in rural areas where visitors often rely on local hospitality. With more than 2,52,000 subscribers, the channel ‘Bihari Babu Entertainment’ has managed 2.7 million viewers in about a year. There are several channels that have multiple videos on child kidnapping, claiming to make people aware. There does not seem to be any justification behind these videos other than monetizing content with wider reach. The channel ‘Arvind Singh Gopalganj’ has couple of videos on kidney racket vis-a-vis child trafficking. In the video below, it is claimed to be an awareness video on such instances. The question is, does the channel need several such disturbing videos to raise awareness on the same topic? The video has had over 3,57,000 views in one year. A common theme in the messages is how the video is based on reports of kidney racket and child trafficking, and the public should scrutinize mendicants or similar loiterers before taking action. The channel ‘psy film production’ has 1,48,000 subscribers. It has several such violent videos on child abduction, but passes its content as comedy. The video below has neither a disclaimer nor a message. It is gory, fear-inducing and disruptive. Underneath, there is also a slideshow of disturbing feature images from the videos of this channel. This slideshow requires JavaScript. There is this Youtube shorts shot to look like a live incident. There is neither a disclaimer nor message. People in the comments section call for police intervention. However, the video is clearly scripted. It violates the condition of context necessary for videos like these as per the guidelines. There are just a bunch of people in the middle of nowhere. There are stock images of mendicants which profile individuals according to religious community, sometimes a Muslim and at times a Hindu . The channel PBC entertainment, with 3,17,000 subscribers, has several gory imagery in its content on child kidnapping. Some of the videos have millions of views. Below is the screenshot of multiple videos from this channel. There are disclaimers given. Similarly, there are videos where a hawker on a cycle is beaten up. The same channel ‘Jhamaru Mahato Comedy’ has a couple of videos on kidney racketeering and child abduction. The FIs are visually disturbing and should be taken down immediately. Below is a screenshot. The viewership of these videos is often in millions. Here are a couple of videos with highly disturbing visuals. Both the above channels, ‘ Bhadohi ka Lavanda ‘ and ‘ SD Vines ‘ have a couple of videos with disturbing feature images. Here are the screenshots: This slideshow requires JavaScript. The channel ‘ Comedian Guru ‘ also has several gory videos. One of them carries a disturbing image of man apparently taking organs out of a child. Channel UP STAR Channel and ‘ Desi Lover ‘, too, use repugnant imagery in several videos on kidney racketeering and child kidnapping. Channel Jhamaru Mahato Comedy has several disturbing content. One of the videos : The channel ‘ Bhagirath Aashiq ‘ passes of as a comedy channel with violent imagery of child kidnapping. It also shows a video normalizing extra-judicial action by police. Channel ‘ Comedy Plus with Neetuarya’ , with 3.36 million subscribers, is a repeat offender. The channel has highly disturbing imagery across several videos on child kidnapping. Here is one of the videos: There is also a video wherein people are seen demanding Aadhar card from people profiled as suspicious. This also raises the issue of privacy over making identification documents public to defend oneself against a mob. Channel ‘ RS Funny ‘ carries images of mutilated children over several videos to show instances of child kidnapping. Summary of the problem at hand The fact that so many channels – as listed above – repetitively create violent content that has proven potential to prompt public reaction and law and order problems shows the inadequacies of YouTube’s monitoring policies. These videos trigger anger and other emotional responses in the public. They normalize mob violence, extra-judicial action by the police, weapons in the hands of vigilantes, and encourage public scrutiny or surveillance on each other. The fact that some of these videos come with advertisements shows that both the platform and the content creator are financially benefiting from such content which have potential risk for causing ‘egregious harm’. There is no transparency on YouTube’s process of defining what it refers to as ‘authoritative information’ or how Indian language experts moderate content that violate community guidelines. The emphasis on ‘ context ‘ as being important to legitimize videos for advertiser-friendly content is not necessarily useful in this context. Majority of the viewers’ comments on the videos do not recommend or suggest flagging the gory content. There is a market for sensationalism and these channels seem to be taking advantage of that. The volume of viewership of some of these videos is staggering, as can be seen in the scroll shot below: Trigger Warning: Violent Content. Viewer discretion is advised. Over the past few months, rumours of child kidnapping have spread like wildfire in many parts of the country based on purported videos of abductions or attempted abductions and mob assaults, viral across social media platforms. Typically, these videos contain gory visuals and a warning that some people are roaming about in a particular area to kidnap children. Back in 2018, IndiaSpend analyzed news reports from across India which said there had been ” …61 (is) number of mob attacks sparked by rumours or suspicion of child-lifting circulated on social media since the beginning of the year. So far this year, 24 persons have been killed in such mob attacks. This more than 4.5 times rise in attacks and two-fold rise in deaths of this kind over 2017, when 11 persons were killed in eight separate attacks”. The report also touched upon the fact that these attacks indicated an erosion of faith in the law enforcement system. A 2018 incident in Assam where two musicians were killed on the suspicion of being child kidnappers received global media attention. Changing Contours of Misinformation Through Videos The nature of misinformation in the context of child kidnapping has undergone some changes over the years. Initially, the viral videos were clipped from longer videos presumably made for raising awareness. Once these videos caused panic, people started attacking unfamiliar faces suspecting them to be child lifters, and the videos of those attacks were shared with the claim that they were actual child kidnappers being punished for their deeds. Subsequently, unrelated gory clips of dead bodies and mutilated corpses were shared as proof of organ trafficking. The rumour-mongering was taken to the next level when YouTube content creators started to upload scripted child-kidnapping videos. Sometimes, they were circulated in regional languages. Eventually, the public reaction to child kidnapping became topical, inspiring the content creators to monetize the rumours through targeted viewership. The economy of staged videos was explained by an Alt News report in the past. News reports have mentioned that the police have time and again appealed to the public to not fall for rumours and refrain from taking law into their hands. This report samples 20-odd scripted videos of child kidnapping and organ trafficking that have the potential to accentuate public fears on the issue, and puts them in the context of existing content moderation policy of YouTube. The objective is to draw attention to the scope and limitations of such policy and methods of moderation in the context of scripted child-kidnapping videos that are disturbing in nature. The Impact of Such Videos There have been numerous reports on the deep social impact of the scripted videos. Often, these rumours affect parents/adults because they fear for the safety of their children. Hence, such content instigates fear, suspicion and panic among people, and often results in an assault on the suspect/s. Besides, these videos create certain stereotypical impressions of who could be a child kidnapper. They are judged on the basis of how they dress and conduct themselves in public. For example, in the scripted videos, individuals are dressed as mendicants/fakirs, scrap dealers, hawkers or even vagabonds. Most of the cases of mob violence are reported from rural areas, a typical setting in the staged videos. While in many cases sadhus and mentally challenged people were at the receiving end, public officials and healthcare workers, too, were not spared. Alt News has addressed and debunked several such rumours and videos of child kidnapping in the past couple of years (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), and done a detailed analysis of real-life consequences of scripted or doctored videos of child abduction. It was observed that between August 30 and September 13, 2022, there were 27 attacks on individuals resulting from rumours of child abduction. There have also been several reports describing how unrelated visuals and scripted videos were passed off as real events. YouTube Policy on moderation The YouTube community guidelines outline a host of categories to address problematic content. The categories that concern us here are the policies on violent content, manipulated content, child safety and thumbnail. YouTube includes the following under violent or graphic content: Inciting others to commit violent acts against individuals or a defined group of people. Fights involving minors. Footage, audio, or imagery involving road accidents, natural disasters, war aftermath, terrorist attack aftermath, street fights, physical attacks, immolation, torture, corpses, protests or riots, robberies, medical procedures, or other such scenarios with the intent to shock or disgust viewers. Footage or imagery showing bodily fluids, such as blood or vomit, with the intent to shock or disgust viewers. Footage of corpses with massive injuries, such as severed limbs. The videos we have sampled contain unsavory, gory thumbnails as well as visuals of physical attacks, torture, corpses etc. for public consumption and presumably to pump viewership. This is in direct contravention to the guidelines on violent or graphic content policies. In most of the cases the thumbnails do not necessarily reflect the actual content in the video, thus manipulating the audience into clicking on it. These videos also fall under the category of manipulated content, described by YouTube as ‘content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm’. The child safety policy outlines conditions that could be flagged as dangerous for minors. It states, “never put minors in harmful situations that may lead to injury, including dangerous stunts, dares, or pranks”. The videos have images of children being lifted and bagged, carried away recklessly, sometimes a weapon held in close proximity to them. These ‘dangerous stunts’ clearly violate the child safety policy. The thumbnail policy lists various kinds of images that can’t be posted as thumbnails. They include Violent imagery that intends to shock or disgust Graphic or disturbing imagery with blood or gore A thumbnail that misleads viewers to think they’re about to view something that’s not in the video It is pertinent to note that YouTube monetization policy mentions that to be eligible to monetize content, the content creator has to follow the community guidelines. “Violation of our YouTube channel monetization policies may result in monetization being suspended or permanently disabled on all or any of your accounts,” the policy says. How the videos enlisted below violate the guidelines have been explained above. Here are the screenshots of some of the videos we have sampled that carry advertisements. This slideshow requires JavaScript. The Problem with Disclaimers Alt News has, in the past, documented cases of disingenuous disclaimers in the context of scripted CCTV videos. In the child-kidnapping videos disclaimers come in different forms. A few of the videos carry a written disclaimer on the screen in English for a few seconds, some in Hindi. A lot of disclaimers come towards the end of the video where the cast explains why they made the video. They claim that the content is created for the purposes of entertainment and, at times, to educate adults on the dangers posed by child traffickers. However, in all these cases, the gory clickbait images and disturbing performances like pulling out organs, slashing body etc. serve as a voyeuristic inducement to attract viewership. This makes it a matter of serious content moderation. Questions Galore The effectiveness of policy issues is intrinsically linked to the dynamics of viewership. The questions that assume significance here include — Who are the stakeholders? Who is getting affected by the consumption of these violent videos? Is it only a law enforcement issue? What is the consent system in place to create content performed by children? How does YouTube monitor which of such channels are ‘authoritative voices’? Every policy has a target audience. The nature of the videos and ground reports of public reaction to suspicions of child-kidnapping certainly show that the target audience here is parents, guardians and impressionable teens, most likely living in rural areas, where children are likely to have lesser parental surveillance. To add to the conversation on moderation, it is useful to look at it from the perspective of the rights of children. The YouTube policy guideline on children is restricted to abusive content or content that is sexual in nature. The guidelines are not exhaustive about what kind of behaviour could be deemed violent or obscene in respect of children. There is scope to create additional check gates for such videos by bringing in the question of the rights of children. Responding to some of the above queries by Alt News, a YouTube communications representative said the platform’s responsibility efforts were focused on four pillars: removing violative content, raising up authoritative content, reducing the spread of borderline content and rewarding trusted creators. More than 20,000 people around the world, including those with Indian language expertise, work to review and remove content that violates our policies, they added. They also made the point that raising authoritative information was as important for the platform as removing violative content, and improving the platform to prevent the spread of harmful misinformation was a continuous process. Recently, YouTube has flagged some gory videos involving children as inappropriate for some users. They are either unavailable or carry the warning that it is inappropriate for some users. Here are a few links to some of these videos: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Sample Videos Most instances of child kidnapping rumours have a trend or pattern in terms of public perception. For example, the kind of people being profiled, the nature of public behaviour that would tantamount to suspicious activity, etc. The video below suggests how a child trafficker looks like. It creates the image of a person in tattered clothes or someone dealing with scraps, as a potential abductor. The disclaimer is posted at the beginning of the video and the text is in English, not necessarily the preferred language of the audience. The video was uploaded in 2019 and has garnered over 12 million views. In the the second video (below), youngsters run amok with weapons to catch abductors. The disclaimer mentions the purpose of the video is entertainment. The feature image has two scary looking men stabbing a child. How does such an image come under the purview of entertainment? The video shows a group of armed youngsters taking law into their own hands. The channel ‘The Three Bro’ has over 3,34,000 subscribers and in one year, this video has gathered over 29 million views. In the following video, the imagery is disturbing. Weapons are brandished to rip open children. There is a message in the end asking people to be wary of house guests. Such commentary is problematic in rural areas where visitors often rely on local hospitality. With more than 2,52,000 subscribers, the channel ‘Bihari Babu Entertainment’ has managed 2.7 million viewers in about a year. There are several channels that have multiple videos on child kidnapping, claiming to make people aware. There does not seem to be any justification behind these videos other than monetizing content with wider reach. The channel ‘Arvind Singh Gopalganj’ has couple of videos on kidney racket vis-a-vis child trafficking. In the video below, it is claimed to be an awareness video on such instances. The question is, does the channel need several such disturbing videos to raise awareness on the same topic? The video has had over 3,57,000 views in one year. A common theme in the messages is how the video is based on reports of kidney racket and child trafficking, and the public should scrutinize mendicants or similar loiterers before taking action. The channel ‘psy film production’ has 1,48,000 subscribers. It has several such violent videos on child abduction, but passes its content as comedy. The video below has neither a disclaimer nor a message. It is gory, fear-inducing and disruptive. Underneath, there is also a slideshow of disturbing feature images from the videos of this channel. This slideshow requires JavaScript. There is this Youtube shorts shot to look like a live incident. There is neither a disclaimer nor message. People in the comments section call for police intervention. However, the video is clearly scripted. It violates the condition of context necessary for videos like these as per the guidelines. There are just a bunch of people in the middle of nowhere. There are stock images of mendicants which profile individuals according to religious community, sometimes a Muslim and at times a Hindu. The channel PBC entertainment, with 3,17,000 subscribers, has several gory imagery in its content on child kidnapping. Some of the videos have millions of views. Below is the screenshot of multiple videos from this channel. There are disclaimers given. Similarly, there are videos where a hawker on a cycle is beaten up. The same channel ‘Jhamaru Mahato Comedy’ has a couple of videos on kidney racketeering and child abduction. The FIs are visually disturbing and should be taken down immediately. Below is a screenshot. The viewership of these videos is often in millions. Here are a couple of videos with highly disturbing visuals. Both the above channels, ‘Bhadohi ka Lavanda‘ and ‘SD Vines‘ have a couple of videos with disturbing feature images. Here are the screenshots: This slideshow requires JavaScript. The channel ‘Comedian Guru‘ also has several gory videos. One of them carries a disturbing image of man apparently taking organs out of a child. Channel UP STAR Channel and ‘Desi Lover‘, too, use repugnant imagery in several videos on kidney racketeering and child kidnapping. Channel Jhamaru Mahato Comedy has several disturbing content. One of the videos : The channel ‘Bhagirath Aashiq‘ passes of as a comedy channel with violent imagery of child kidnapping. It also shows a video normalizing extra-judicial action by police. Channel ‘Comedy Plus with Neetuarya’, with 3.36 million subscribers, is a repeat offender. The channel has highly disturbing imagery across several videos on child kidnapping. Here is one of the videos: There is also a video wherein people are seen demanding Aadhar card from people profiled as suspicious. This also raises the issue of privacy over making identification documents public to defend oneself against a mob. Channel ‘RS Funny‘ carries images of mutilated children over several videos to show instances of child kidnapping. Summary of the problem at hand The fact that so many channels – as listed above – repetitively create violent content that has proven potential to prompt public reaction and law and order problems shows the inadequacies of YouTube’s monitoring policies. These videos trigger anger and other emotional responses in the public. They normalize mob violence, extra-judicial action by the police, weapons in the hands of vigilantes, and encourage public scrutiny or surveillance on each other. The fact that some of these videos come with advertisements shows that both the platform and the content creator are financially benefiting from such content which have potential risk for causing ‘egregious harm’. There is no transparency on YouTube’s process of defining what it refers to as ‘authoritative information’ or how Indian language experts moderate content that violate community guidelines. The emphasis on ‘context‘ as being important to legitimize videos for advertiser-friendly content is not necessarily useful in this context. Majority of the viewers’ comments on the videos do not recommend or suggest flagging the gory content. There is a market for sensationalism and these channels seem to be taking advantage of that. The volume of viewership of some of these videos is staggering, as can be seen in the scroll shot below:",Mahaprajna Nayak,,,1

Several news media outlets including OpIndia , Zee News , Film Companion , The Statesman , Outlook , Times of India and others reported on this. Many reports mentioned, “According to a recent investigation, since 2009, nearly 32,000 girls from the Hindu and Christian communities in Kerala and Mangalore have converted to Islam; the majority of them end up in Syria, Afghanistan, and other regions with a high concentration of ISIS and Haqqani influence”.

This slideshow requires JavaScript. No evidence to back 32,000-claim Alt News found an interview of Sudipto Sen on YouTube channel ‘The Festival of Bharat’ where he talks about how he calculated the figure. From the 45-second mark onward, he says, “In 2010, former Kerala CM Oommen Chandy put a report in front of Kerala assembly. In front of my camera, he denied that anything had happened. But in 2010, I documented a case where he (Chandy) said that every year approximately 2,800 to 3,200 girls were taking up Islam. Just calculate it for the following 10 years, and the number is around 32,000.” We spoke with Sen over phone to find out whether the claims made by social media users based on the figure 32,000 mentioned in the teaser had any factual basis. Sen said, “This figure (32,000) is not mine. It was a piece of news in The Times of India… one thing I can tell you is that Oommen Chandy, the chief minister of Kerala, had placed this number in the state assembly. So this is not my number, I have got all the documents with me.” He also said, “VS Achuthanandan has categorically said Kerala will become an Islamic state…”. Alt News could not find any report by any media outlet which said that 32,000 women from Kerala had joined the ISIS. The number is so large that had there been such a statement by a chief minister, it would certainly have made headlines. We, however, found a 2012 India Today report which said, “On June 25, Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy informed the state legislature that 2,667 young women converted to Islam in the state since 2006” (that is, from 2006 to 2012). There is no mention in the report of women joining the ISIS. The report added that Chandy had said there was no evidence for forced conversions in the state and the fears about love jihad were baseless. The New Indian Express also quoted Chandy and mentioned the same data. None of the reports talked about any annual figure cited by the former CM, as claimed by Sen. When Alt News shared the India Today report with Sudipto Sen and requested him to share the said ‘TOI report’ or other sources that he might have, with us, Sen said over a WhatsApp message, “Let the intolerance reach a crescendo. I’ll share my data after the film is released. Why should I defeat the cause of my film?” Achuthanandan’s remarks wrongly used in teaser In the YouTube interview , Sen also says, “15-16 years ago, in 2005, CPM patriarch VS Achuthanandan, who was the chief minister at the time, came down to Delhi and had a press conference. He made a shocking revelation; he said that a sinister plan has been hatched by Islamic extremists led by ISIS that they want to convert Kerala into the hub of ISIS. For that, they are taking all sorts of means.” Sen used a clip of the press conference in the first teaser of ‘The Kerala Story’ released in March 2022. When we dug into the reported statements made by the Leftist leader, we found two things — The press conference had actually taken place on July 24, 2010. Achuthanandan had spoken about the Popular Front of India (PFI), and his comments created much controversy . The clip that has been used in the teaser is misleading because the words spoken by Achuthanandan and the subtitle used in it are completely different. The actual words can be translated as “Independence Day on August 15…when nationalists and patriots take part in celebrations.. Youngsters are influenced.. lured with money…”, while the subtitle in ‘The Kerala Story’ promo reads, “The Popular Front is trying to make Kerala a Muslim state just like the agenda of the banned organization NDF. Their plan is to make Kerala a Muslim state within 20 years.” Some viewers had, in fact, pointed out in the comments section that the subtitles and the spoken words did not match. So, it is evident that the filmmaker has misquoted both Oommen Chandy and VS Achuthanandan to give his take on the state of affairs in Kerala an air of credibility. We found other users as well who pointed out the same. This slideshow requires JavaScript. However, the readers should note that VS Achuthanandan did speak about ‘love jihad’ . TOI quoted the Left leader as saying, “PFI was trying to multiply Muslim numbers in the state “by influencing youth of other religions and converting them by giving money, marrying them to Muslim women and thus producing kids of the community.” The Congress criticized the comments as part of the Left’s plans to appease the majority community. Interestingly, among those reacting sharply to the CM’s comments was Oommen Chandy (who was an Opposition leader at the time). Achuthanandan later reiterated his stand in the state assembly and clarified that his remark against the PFI was being ‘misinterpreted’ as directed against the entire Muslim community. 2018 film, too, talked about 32,000 conversions In 2018, Sen made a 52-minute documentary titled ‘ In the Name of Love! ‘. In the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the plot reads, “As per a recent report, since 2009 – more than 17 thousand girls from Kerala and more 15 thousand girls from Mangalore from Hindu and Christian communities has been converted to Islam and most of them ended up landing in Syria, Afghanistan, and other ISIS and Taliban influential areas.” (sic) Interestingly, the figure 32,000 (17000+15000) shows up here as well. A screening of the film at JNU had resulted in a scuffle between two groups of students. Alt News requested the filmmaker to share with us the ‘recent report’ mentioned in the synopsis of the film and other evidence which corroborate the numbers mentioned. The article will be updated as and when he responds to our query. After the chaos at JNU over the screening of his film, Sen claimed that his film was not about Love Jihad. TOI reported that some crew members of the film had, however, refuted him. In a statement to ThePrint , Sen said, “First of all, let me clarify that I do not belong to the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). I come from a Communist family and do not believe in ‘love jihad’, a concept which is even being propagated by the likes of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. And this is exactly what I wanted to show through my film”. However, 19.48-minute mark onward in the YouTube interview mentioned above, Sen says, “Now I am making a feature film… on the subject of Love Jihad; how these girls (are) being converted. It’s a huge sinister plan…” Available data on Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS Alt News reached out to Kerala Police. A public relation officer speaking to us labelled the claim made in the teaser of ‘The Kerala Story’ — that 32,000 women from Kerala have been trafficked to Syria — as ‘totally baseless’. As per the United States Department of State’s Country Reports on Terrorism 2020 there were 66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS as of November, 2020. A number of mainstream media houses, including The Hindustan Times and The Indian Express , had covered the publication of the report and mentioned the number 66 in their headlines. The same report said, “Through the end of September, the NIA had investigated 34 terrorism cases it indicated were related to ISIS and arrested 160 persons.” The Hindu reported in June 2021 that four Indian women were lodged in an Afghanistan prison, who had accompanied their husbands to join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), and they were unlikely to be allowed to return to the country. The Week reported that the four women, believed to be Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha, Raffeala, Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam and Nimisha alias Fathima Isa, had traveled to Nangarhar in Afghanistan between 2016 and 2018. The Observer Research Foundation, a prominent think tank, in 2019 published a document titled ‘ The Islamic State in India’s Kerala: A primer ‘. A section in the paper titled ‘Why IS and Kerala?’ says, “The number of pro-IS cases reported in India from 2014 to 2018 is between 180 – 200. This paper defines ‘pro-IS cases’ to include sharing or propagating IS propaganda online, attempting to travel to West Asia with the aim of joining the caliphate, and in fact joining the caliphate or working for its goals. The Indian Home Ministry puts the number at 155.” One of the authors of the paper — Mohammed Sinan Siyech — told Alt News, “There are many problems with the figure of 32000 women joining the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria from India. The total number of people who joined ISIS from the whole world numbers up to 40 000 foreign fighters from 110 countries. (source: The Soufan Group Report titled ‘Beyond the Caliphate, 2017’). The largest contributors were the EU, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. India barely features in the list. According to Indian government figures, not more than a total of 100 – 200 joined the group from India. Keralites make up around 20- 25% of these figures. (source: ‘The ISIS phenomenon: South Asia and beyond’ – an ORF report).” Siyech added, “There is no mention of any figures from any source that would show that more than 200 people joined ISIS from India. In fact, this number is so small that most academics and experts often ask the question ‘What had prevented Indian Muslims from joining the Islamic State?” The teaser of a movie titled ‘The Kerala Story’ is being widely shared on social media in which a burqa-clad woman recounts her past as a Hindu named Shalini Unnikrishnan who wanted to be a nurse. She then says that she is currently an ISIS terrorist lodged in an Afghanistan jail, and goes by the name Fatima Ba. Fatima also says that there are 32,000 girls like her who have been converted to Islam and sent to Syria and Yemen. “A dangerous game is on in Kerala to convert normal girls to dangerous terrorists, that too in front of everyone’s eyes,” she adds. Many users shared the teaser saying/implying that it was the actual story of a woman from Kerala. Some used the hashtag #TrueStory. Directed by Sudipto Sen and produced by Vipul Amrutlal Shah, ‘The Kerala Story’ claims to unearth the happenings behind 32,000 women who went missing in the state of Kerala.

Many reports mentioned, “According to a recent investigation, since 2009, nearly 32,000 girls from the Hindu and Christian communities in Kerala and Mangalore have converted to Islam; the majority of them end up in Syria, Afghanistan, and other regions with a high concentration of ISIS and Haqqani influence”.

Panchjanya, the national weekly magazine published by the RSS, tweeted the teaser with the caption, “शालिनी से फातिमा बनी लड़की !! नर्स बनने वाली लड़की कैसे बन गयी ISIS की आतंकवादी !! फ़िल्म “The Kerala Story” 32 हजार महिलाओं की कहानी लेकर आ रही है जिसे जबरन मुस्लिम बनाकर ISIS का आतंकवादी बनाया गया !!”.

No evidence to back 32,000-claim Alt News found an interview of Sudipto Sen on YouTube channel ‘The Festival of Bharat’ where he talks about how he calculated the figure. From the 45-second mark onward, he says, “In 2010, former Kerala CM Oommen Chandy put a report in front of Kerala assembly. In front of my camera, he denied that anything had happened. But in 2010, I documented a case where he (Chandy) said that every year approximately 2,800 to 3,200 girls were taking up Islam. Just calculate it for the following 10 years, and the number is around 32,000.” We spoke with Sen over phone to find out whether the claims made by social media users based on the figure 32,000 mentioned in the teaser had any factual basis. Sen said, “This figure (32,000) is not mine. It was a piece of news in The Times of India… one thing I can tell you is that Oommen Chandy, the chief minister of Kerala, had placed this number in the state assembly. So this is not my number, I have got all the documents with me.” He also said, “VS Achuthanandan has categorically said Kerala will become an Islamic state…”. Alt News could not find any report by any media outlet which said that 32,000 women from Kerala had joined the ISIS. The number is so large that had there been such a statement by a chief minister, it would certainly have made headlines. We, however, found a 2012 India Today report which said, “On June 25, Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy informed the state legislature that 2,667 young women converted to Islam in the state since 2006” (that is, from 2006 to 2012). There is no mention in the report of women joining the ISIS. The report added that Chandy had said there was no evidence for forced conversions in the state and the fears about love jihad were baseless. The New Indian Express also quoted Chandy and mentioned the same data. None of the reports talked about any annual figure cited by the former CM, as claimed by Sen. When Alt News shared the India Today report with Sudipto Sen and requested him to share the said ‘TOI report’ or other sources that he might have, with us, Sen said over a WhatsApp message, “Let the intolerance reach a crescendo. I’ll share my data after the film is released. Why should I defeat the cause of my film?” Achuthanandan’s remarks wrongly used in teaser In the YouTube interview, Sen also says, “15-16 years ago, in 2005, CPM patriarch VS Achuthanandan, who was the chief minister at the time, came down to Delhi and had a press conference. He made a shocking revelation; he said that a sinister plan has been hatched by Islamic extremists led by ISIS that they want to convert Kerala into the hub of ISIS. For that, they are taking all sorts of means.” Sen used a clip of the press conference in the first teaser of ‘The Kerala Story’ released in March 2022. When we dug into the reported statements made by the Leftist leader, we found two things — The press conference had actually taken place on July 24, 2010. Achuthanandan had spoken about the Popular Front of India (PFI), and his comments created much controversy. The clip that has been used in the teaser is misleading because the words spoken by Achuthanandan and the subtitle used in it are completely different. The actual words can be translated as “Independence Day on August 15…when nationalists and patriots take part in celebrations.. Youngsters are influenced.. lured with money…”, while the subtitle in ‘The Kerala Story’ promo reads, “The Popular Front is trying to make Kerala a Muslim state just like the agenda of the banned organization NDF. Their plan is to make Kerala a Muslim state within 20 years.” Some viewers had, in fact, pointed out in the comments section that the subtitles and the spoken words did not match. So, it is evident that the filmmaker has misquoted both Oommen Chandy and VS Achuthanandan to give his take on the state of affairs in Kerala an air of credibility. We found other users as well who pointed out the same. This slideshow requires JavaScript. However, the readers should note that VS Achuthanandan did speak about ‘love jihad’. TOI quoted the Left leader as saying, “PFI was trying to multiply Muslim numbers in the state “by influencing youth of other religions and converting them by giving money, marrying them to Muslim women and thus producing kids of the community.” The Congress criticized the comments as part of the Left’s plans to appease the majority community. Interestingly, among those reacting sharply to the CM’s comments was Oommen Chandy (who was an Opposition leader at the time). Achuthanandan later reiterated his stand in the state assembly and clarified that his remark against the PFI was being ‘misinterpreted’ as directed against the entire Muslim community. 2018 film, too, talked about 32,000 conversions In 2018, Sen made a 52-minute documentary titled ‘In the Name of Love!‘. In the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the plot reads, “As per a recent report, since 2009 – more than 17 thousand girls from Kerala and more 15 thousand girls from Mangalore from Hindu and Christian communities has been converted to Islam and most of them ended up landing in Syria, Afghanistan, and other ISIS and Taliban influential areas.” (sic) Interestingly, the figure 32,000 (17000+15000) shows up here as well. A screening of the film at JNU had resulted in a scuffle between two groups of students. Alt News requested the filmmaker to share with us the ‘recent report’ mentioned in the synopsis of the film and other evidence which corroborate the numbers mentioned. The article will be updated as and when he responds to our query. After the chaos at JNU over the screening of his film, Sen claimed that his film was not about Love Jihad. TOI reported that some crew members of the film had, however, refuted him. In a statement to ThePrint, Sen said, “First of all, let me clarify that I do not belong to the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). I come from a Communist family and do not believe in ‘love jihad’, a concept which is even being propagated by the likes of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. And this is exactly what I wanted to show through my film”. However, 19.48-minute mark onward in the YouTube interview mentioned above, Sen says, “Now I am making a feature film… on the subject of Love Jihad; how these girls (are) being converted. It’s a huge sinister plan…” Available data on Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS Alt News reached out to Kerala Police. A public relation officer speaking to us labelled the claim made in the teaser of ‘The Kerala Story’ — that 32,000 women from Kerala have been trafficked to Syria — as ‘totally baseless’. As per the United States Department of State’s Country Reports on Terrorism 2020 there were 66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS as of November, 2020. A number of mainstream media houses, including The Hindustan Times and The Indian Express, had covered the publication of the report and mentioned the number 66 in their headlines. The same report said, “Through the end of September, the NIA had investigated 34 terrorism cases it indicated were related to ISIS and arrested 160 persons.” The Hindu reported in June 2021 that four Indian women were lodged in an Afghanistan prison, who had accompanied their husbands to join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), and they were unlikely to be allowed to return to the country. The Week reported that the four women, believed to be Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha, Raffeala, Merrin Jacob alias Mariyam and Nimisha alias Fathima Isa, had traveled to Nangarhar in Afghanistan between 2016 and 2018. The Observer Research Foundation, a prominent think tank, in 2019 published a document titled ‘The Islamic State in India’s Kerala: A primer‘. A section in the paper titled ‘Why IS and Kerala?’ says, “The number of pro-IS cases reported in India from 2014 to 2018 is between 180 – 200. This paper defines ‘pro-IS cases’ to include sharing or propagating IS propaganda online, attempting to travel to West Asia with the aim of joining the caliphate, and in fact joining the caliphate or working for its goals. The Indian Home Ministry puts the number at 155.” One of the authors of the paper — Mohammed Sinan Siyech — told Alt News, “There are many problems with the figure of 32000 women joining the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria from India. The total number of people who joined ISIS from the whole world numbers up to 40 000 foreign fighters from 110 countries. (source: The Soufan Group Report titled ‘Beyond the Caliphate, 2017’). The largest contributors were the EU, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. India barely features in the list. According to Indian government figures, not more than a total of 100 – 200 joined the group from India. Keralites make up around 20- 25% of these figures. (source: ‘The ISIS phenomenon: South Asia and beyond’ – an ORF report).” Siyech added, “There is no mention of any figures from any source that would show that more than 200 people joined ISIS from India. In fact, this number is so small that most academics and experts often ask the question ‘What had prevented Indian Muslims from joining the Islamic State?” To sum it up, Alt News found that Sudipto Sen, the director of ‘The Kerala Story’, has repeatedly claimed that 32,000 women have joined ISIS either from India or just Kerala, and mentioned this in his film, without any evidence to back the claim. Data available in the public domain suggests that the number of ‘Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS’ is far less than that.",Shinjinee Majumder & Archit,False,False,1

When will law catch up with him?",https://i0.wp.com/www.altnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/yati-final.jpg?ssl=1,2022-11-04 13:35:56,2022-11-17 07:36:19,"On April 3, 2022, just about two months after Yati Narsinghanand got bail in the Haridwar Dharam Sansad hate speech case on the condition that he would not deliver provocative...",,"Fourteen days later, he repeated it in Una, Himachal Pradesh . Here, speaking to the media during a hate-spewing assembly in which he took part, Narsinghanand said that Islam’s jihad would eat the entire country. Undaunted by bail conditions imposed on him, Narsinghanand has since delivered speech after speech after speech targeting Muslims, which received thousands of views on YouTube. Not only that, he has announced a three-day dharam sansad in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, from December 17, 2022. After the district administration denied him permission, he said he would hold it at any cost . The Supreme Court recently took a serious note of the ‘disturbing’ nature of hate speeches ‘against one community’ and asked police to take suo moto action in such speech cases ‘even if no complaint is forthcoming and proceed against the offenders’. Keeping this in mind, Yati Narsinghanand’s brazen and repeated violations of bail orders with complete impunity deserve to be highlighted. It is worth noting that the apex court said in its October 21 order that ‘any hesitation to act in accordance with this direction will be viewed as contempt of this Court and appropriate action will be taken against the erring officers.’ What constitutes Hate Speech? According to the United Nations , hate speech ‘refers to offensive discourse targeting a group or an individual based on inherent characteristics (such as race, religion or gender) and that may threaten social peace.’ It identifies hate speech as a ‘ precursor to atrocity crimes, including genocide .’ The Law Commission of India had in March 2017 submitted a report to the Supreme Court on hate speech . On page 38, the report defines hate speech as an ‘expression which is abusive, insulting, intimidating, harassing or which incites violence, hatred or discrimination against groups identified by characteristics such as one’s race, religion, place of birth, residence, region, language, caste or community, sexual orientation or personal convictions.’ Readers can find the Alt News Hate Speech Policy here, follwoing which this report has identified and classified Narsinghanand’s hate speeches. The document has been prepared based on Facebook’s community standard on hate speech, which is the most detailed such document available publicly. Tier 2 of the policy considers the following as hate speech: Expressions of contempt (in written or visual form) , which is defined as: Self-admission to intolerance on the basis of protected characteristics, including, but not limited to: homophobic, islamophobic , racist. Expressions that a protected characteristic shouldn’t exist . Expressions of hate , including, but not limited to: despise, hate. All of Narsinghanand’s public speeches documented below, offline or online, can be designated as hate speech according to the above classification. Who is Yati Narsinghanand? In January 2022, Narsinghanand’s father 83-year-old Rajeshwar Dayal Tyagi told ThePrint that Narsinghanand was born in 1972 in Hirnot village, Bulandshahr. His given name was Deependra Narayan Singh. He also described his son as a brilliant student who had received scholarships based on merit for studying food and chemical technology in Russia. A junior at the college, Arun Tyagi, revealed to ThePrint that Narsinghanand was very popular among the Indian student community, especially because of his culinary expertise and he had started a business providing tiffin services. According to the story, Narsinghanand returned from Russia in 1997 and got married. He had a job offer from Haldiram’s which he declined and moved to Ghaziabad and opened a coaching institute. Around this time, he came under the influence of BJP leader Baikunth Lal Sharma, who later became his mentor. However, it is unclear how Narsinghanand got associated with the Dasna Devi temple and later became the head priest. In March 2021, Narsinghanand shot to fame after he came out in support of two caretakers of the Dasna Devi temple who had been arrested for allegedly beating up a 14-year-old Muslim boy for entering the temple to drink water. At a press conference, he said that he had trained his followers to give a befitting reply to trespassers from a certain minority community and they were simply following his instructions. The Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad also had a poster in place that barred entry to Muslims. After the assault of the minor Muslim boy, this poster was replaced by a larger banner which read the same. In fact, this poster inspired Hindutva groups to put up banners at other temples and shrines warning Muslims and non-Hindus not to enter the premises. The very next month, speaking at another press conference organised by Akhil Bharatiya Sant Parishad at the Press Club of India, Narsinghanand made several inflammatory remarks against the Prophet of Islam. A number of FIRs were filed against him. The Haridwar Dharam Sansad From December 17 to 19, 2021, a large gathering of Right-Wing religious leaders , including some affiliated with the BJP, took place in Haridwar. The event was termed ‘Dharam Sansad’ or religious parliament. On all the three days, this event witnessed an extraordinary outpouring of hate speech, call for violence and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Videos of the Haridwar Dharam Sansad soon started circulating on social media. BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay was also an attendee of the event and had brought a ‘saffron constitution’ to Dharam Sansad. The police took cognizance of the videos and filed an FIR on December 23. सोशल मीडिया पर धर्म विशेष के खिलाफ भड़काऊ भाषण देकर नफरत फैलाने संबंधी वायरल हो रहे वीडियो का संज्ञान लेते हुए वसीम रिजवी उर्फ जितेंद्र नारायण त्यागी एवं अन्य के विरुद्ध कोतवाली हरिद्वार में धारा 153A IPC के अंतर्गत मुकदमा पंजीकृत किया गया है और विधिक कार्यवाही प्रचलित है। @ANI pic.twitter.com/0NLBwPqQhV — Uttarakhand Police (@uttarakhandcops) December 23, 2021 On January 13, Jitendra Narayan Tyagi, formerly known as Wasim Rizvi, one of the speakers, was arrested for hate speech. A video of the conversation between Yati Narsinghanand and the Haridwar Police during Tyagi’s arrest also went viral on social media. In the clip, it appeared as if the police are begging the mahamandaleshwar of the Juna Akhara to allow them to arrest Tyagi. Here, Narsinghanand can also be heard saying to the police that they will all die (“ Tum sab maroge “).

Uttarakhand | Yati Narsinghanand has been arrested today, in connection with a case pertaining to derogatory remarks against women. He has 2-3 cases registered against him: CO City, Haridwar pic.twitter.com/mMs1YI6R9x — ANI UP/Uttarakhand (@ANINewsUP) January 15, 2022 After staying in judicial custody for almost a month, he received bail on February 7 in the Haridwar hate speech case and on February 14, in the case pertaining to derogatory comments against women. As has been stated earlier, Narsinghanand’s bail conditions included giving an undertaking that he would not repeat the same offence he had been arrested for or participate in any event that can cause enmity between communities. Burari Hindu Mahapanchayat Less than two months after his bail, Narsinghanand appeared on the stage at the Burari Hindu Mahapanchayat on April 3 organised by Seva India Foundation and other Hindu organisations, reportedly without police permission. In one of the clips available in public domain, he says that once a Muslim becomes the Prime Minister of the country, 50% of the attendees will have to change their religion. He further says that the Muslims in the country are not from Arab, they were once friends and family of Hindus. He also adds that 40% of Hindus will be murdered, and the rest 10% of Hindus will give away their sisters and daughters to Muslims and will either live in refugee camps or in foreign lands. Narsinghanand also urges the Hindus to be man enough to take up arms if they wanted to alter their future. The entire above speech falls under Tier 2 (3.1) as it is Islamophobic in nature. Besides, it peddles a conspiracy theory that once Muslims come to power, they will essentially exterminate the Hindu population. Moreover, it is a form of speech that could incite imminent violence or intimidation. Yati Narsinghanand is at it again, he asks “Hindus” to take up arms against “Muslims” while addressing a crowd gathered at the ongoing “Hindu Mahapanchayat” in Delhi’s Burari ground. “If you want to change the future, become a man,man is the one who has arms in hand,” Yati said. pic.twitter.com/ABuX2B58UU — Mahmodul Hassan (@mhassanism) April 3, 2022 In another clip, he says that those who are capable of giving birth should go now and give birth to children, and make the children worthy to fight. Yati Narsinghanand further asks “Hindus” to give birth to children and make them worthy to fight. “Only give birth to children, go now and give birth to children, and make your children worthy to fight,” he said at “Hindu Mahapanchayat” in Delhi today. pic.twitter.com/9CmvGMWP9a — Mahmodul Hassan (@mhassanism) April 3, 2022 Both the viral clips show a clear violation of the bail conditions by Yati Narsinghanand. In this same event, several journalists affiliated with Article 14 and Newslaundry were assaulted. There were also reports of the mob forcing journalists to delete footage of the event from their devices. Una Dharam Sansad 14 days after the Hindu Mahapanchayat in Delhi’s Burarai, Yati appeared in another Dharam Sansad, this time in Una. There are no publicly available clips to verify if Narsinghanand spoke at the Una conclave. However, he did speak to the media during this event. He said that Islam’s jihad will eat the entirety of the country and that the population of Muslims was increasing exponentially. He also said that the population of Muslims had increased in the hills and hence the crime rate had gone up. This falls under Tier 1 (2.7) of the hate speech policy as it generalizes Muslims as criminals and also peddles the theory that an increase in Muslim population leads to an increase in crimes. [Generalisations or unqualified behavioural statements (in written or visual form) to or about criminals (including, but not limited to, ‘thieves’, ‘bank robbers’ or saying ‘All [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] are ‘criminals’]’. Yati Narsinghanand was also a speaker at the Una Dharm Sansad. He said, “Population of muslims is rising” and stressed on the need for Hindus to produce more kids. According to his bail condition in Haridwar Dharm Sansad case, he is not allowed to take part in these events. pic.twitter.com/P6uHDnfr8S — Kaushik Raj (@kaushikrj6) April 17, 2022 Live streams on YouTube and the Doomsday Theory Ever since Narsinghanand got out of jail, he has taken part in several YouTube live streams. On going through Narsinghanand’s YouTube speeches, Alt News found that there are a few points that he makes repeatedly. One of them is the idea that ‘Islam’s jihad’ will destroy India. He keeps on saying that by 2029, India will have a Muslim PM and this will be the beginning of the extermination of Hindus. He also likes to harp on the string that Islam is a fundamentally corrupt and violent religion that believes in destroying others and Hindus should be prepared. Another claim that he makes almost every time he is at the microphone is that religious texts of Muslims, that is, the Quran and the Hadith, tell Muslims that they can rape, murder, loot people from other religions, or ‘kafirs’. The only way for the Hindus to defeat this enemy is by being physically prepared, giving birth to as many child as possible and pick up arms. He also often makes the claim that most of the religions of the world, if not all, are at war against Muslims. Moreover, all of his speeches contain loads of misinformation and conspiracy theories unsupported by any evidence, which function as a launchpad for him. Live stream #1 On April 3 around 2:30 PM IST, the same day as the Hindu Mahapanchayat in Burari, Narsinghanand appeared on a YouTube live stream on the channel ‘Swami Armitanand Bhakti’, run by Swami Amritanand, a close associate of Narsinghanand. The channel has around 20.9K subscribers and the live stream received 6,066 views. The topic for this stream was ‘Vijay ya veergati’ (Victory or gallantry). At the 6:38-minute mark, Swami Amritanand says that there is a latest government press release as per which it is said that in the last one week in West Bengal, around 800 bombs, 15 rifles and 150 shotguns have been recovered from a ‘certain community’. He then asks Yati Narsinghanand about the outrage that is caused when they speak of such facts. To this Narsinghanand responds by saying that the Hindu community only knows how to do politics to fulfil self-interest. The Muslims, he says, are doing their job with honesty, that is, they are following what the Quran says and not doing anything that is not mentioned in there, implying that Muslims are inherently violent and it is part of their religion. In this same stream, at the 8:53-minute mark, Narsinghanand argues that Hindus are not producing children, not becoming strong physically, and are not prepared for a battle. He argues that Hindus are becoming economically strong but there is no meaning to that. At the 9:20-minute, the co-host asks why the Hindu community does not come to his support. Narsinghanand responds by saying that Hindus are not interested in saving their sisters and daughters. They are only interested in watching their sisters and daughters get raped by Muslims and later get sold in the markets. He says that Hindus have a slave mindset hence they don’t come to his support. At the 14:15-minute mark, Yati compared Muslims to wolves/beasts. This part can be categorized under Tier 1 (2.4) of the policy — Dehumanising speech or imagery in the form of comparisons, generalisations or unqualified behavioural statements (in written or visual form) to or about sexual predator. From the 14:58-minute mark, they extensively talk about the kinds of people who are leading this country and are ‘fooling’ Hindus. Swami Jitendranand also raises the issue of the Government of India not providing enough security for Yati Narsinghanand. Narsinghanand says that the government is providing security to those saints who are leading Hindus to the den of Muslims to get murdered. At the 17:55-minute mark, Narsinghanand says that BJP-RSS are here to promote self-interests before Muslims take over and rule Hindus in 2029 (Intimidation) . He says that after 2029, they are going to give away their sisters and daughters to Muslims anyway. (Tier 1 – 2.4) Narsinghanand ends his bit of the stream by talking about Maulana Tauqeer Raza, and how the person was not arrested despite giving out objectionable speech, he also mentions that even nationalist news anchors are saying that he spews venom. Live stream #2 The second live stream was held on ‘Swami Amritanand Bhakti’ in the evening of April 18 around 8 PM IST. This stream received 2,738 views and it is the lengthiest Yati Narsinghanand has been live on YouTube since his bail. This stream was held on the day Narsinghanand and Amritanand were returning from the Una Dharam Sansad. The stream begins with Amritanand asking Narsinghanand why the speeches at the Dharam Sansad are termed hate speech. Narsinghanand responds by saying that Dharam Sansad-like events are enlightening Hindus and this has rattled the ‘jihadis’. At the 17:55-minute mark onward, to a question asked by Amritanand, Narsinghanand says that as per the hadiths, a ‘kafir’ can be raped, murdered and even looted, none of which is considered a crime. He adds that wherever sharia is implemented, the murder of a ‘kafir’ is seen as a reward. He also says that wherever Muslims are in majority, Hindus are not even allowed to breathe. (Tier 1 – 2.6) At the 44:17-minute mark, Narsinghanand says “They don’t spare their own mothers, sisters and daughters” (translated) – (Tier 1 – 2.6) . Just after this, at the 44:27-minute mark, he says, “In Bangladesh when Muslims go to rape Hindus, their mothers say go one by one or else my daughter will die” (translated) — (Tier 1 – 2.6) . At the 47:36-minute mark, Amritanand says Muslims are more shameless than animals. He says that it is written in the Hadith that they can rape the dead. The rest of the stream till the end remains in the form of a Q&A. It is pertinent to note, throughout this live stream, Narsinghanand also targets the RSS-BJP. He thinks that the BJP-RSS speaks a different language when they are not in power and take a U-turn when they are in power. Live stream #3: The Interview The third live stream on the Swami Amritanand Bhakti channel was done on May 20, around 2:41 PM. It received a total of 10,171 views. Unlike the first two streams, this one did not feature Narsinghanand. Instead, another interview with him shot a few days back was broadcast. At the 7:15-minute mark, interviewer Sachin Tiwari asks Narisnghanand how Hindutva will emerge stronger and how Gyanvapi has become an issue these days. In his usual style, Narisnghanand starts by saying that Hindus are fools, he says “which Hindu did not know that Gyanvapi was a temple and not a mosque?” He then adds that which Hindus do not know that the mosque in Mathura, too, is actually a temple. Narsinghanand says that it is good that these places of worship are being returned to Hindus but the focus should not solely be on that. “ Isse jyada humein dhyan iss baat pe dena chahiye ki Bharat pe Islam ke jihadiyon kabza na ho jaye. Pata chala hum kewal mandiron ki ladai ladte rahe aur itne dino main musalman jihadis pure bharat pe kabza kar le. ” (“More than this, we should focus on the fact that India might get captured by the jihadis of Islam. Our focus will solely remain on temples and one day we will find out that Muslim jihadis have captured the entire country”) — (Tier 2 – 3.1) . He says that the whole focus should be on creating a Sanatan Rashtra (Hindurashtra), and only then will Sanatan dharma survive. He adds, “ Mandir banne chahiye lekin dekhiye sthiti ye hai ki agar musalmano ka raaj aya to ek bhi mandir yaha bachna nahi h, jo mandir aaj ke hai ye bhi nahi bachne hai . (Temples should be built but the condition is such that if Muslims start ruling this country, not a single temple will survive, and even those temples that were built today will vanish). (Intimidation) He also says that the religion of Islam was born to destroy Hindu temples. The first temple that was destroyed was in Mecca, the ‘Makkeshwar Mahadev’ temple [referring to the conspiracy theory that the Kaaba is a Shiva temple]. Narsinghanand adds that he cannot expand upon these topics because of the restrictions imposed upon him by the courts. However, he doesn’t relent. He immediately says that, “ Humara bhavishya tabhi zinda rahega jab hum bachengay. ” (“our future will only exist if we survive”.) He adds, “ Pata chala hum toh mar gaye fir chahe jitne mandir ho jitne gaushalaye ho, jitne ashram ho ye kis kaam aane hai. Woh Jihadiyon ke kaam aane hai woh unhe masjid banaengay, waha apni aiyyashi karengay, apna maza lengay. ” (“One day we will find out that we all are dead and all our temples, gaushala, and ashrams will be of no use. They will be useful to the jihadis, they will convert those places to mosques, they will enjoy there, they will take pleasure there”.) (Intimidation, Tier 2- 3.1) He also says, “ Islam ke basic jo samjhiye. Aapka jo bhi kuch hai, usey cheen na, aap ki hatya karna, aapke maal ko ganimat maan kar hajam kar jana, aapki aurton ko ya to balatkar karke mandiyon main bechna, ya apni sex slave banake apne pas rakh lena. Ye islam ka uddeshiya hai. Isko samjhe bina, hum Islam ko samjh hi nahi sakte. ” (“Understand the basics of Islam. To steal everything from you, to kill you, to take away all your belongings, to rape your women and then sell them in the markets or to turn your women into their sex slaves and keep them for themselves. This is the basic goal of Islam. Without understanding this, we will never be able to understand Islam”.) (Tier 2 – 3.1. Tier 1 – 2.6). The interviewer then moves to the other guests. At the 23:22-minute mark, Amirtanand takes over and starts asking questions to Narsinghanand about the ‘restrictions’ implemented on him by the courts. What Narisnghanand says can be translated as follows: “Look, this is true that the court has put such a huge restriction upon me and I will never be able to tell the truth about Mohammad which I had earlier brought before the world. Now I will never be able to tell that Mohammad was a thief, that Mohammed was a dacoit, that Mohammed was a rapist, that Mohammed was a seller of women, that Mohammed was a merciless killer, that Mohammad was the founder of organised crime. Islam is an organised gang of criminals”. (Tier 2 – 3.1. Tier 1 – 2.6) . Live stream #4 The fourth live stream was held in the evening on June 19, on the same channel. The stream was led by Swami Amritanand and it featured Santosh Das and Yati Narsinghanand. The stream received 4,400 views and the topic of the conversation was “धर्म परिवर्तन एवं धर्म परावर्तन पर विशेष चर्चा” (Special conversation on religious conversion and religious enforcement). The conversation with Narsinghanand begins at the 1:09:00-minute mark with Das narrating a poem about religious conversations. Narsinghanand gets disconnected from the stream and another guest, named ‘the Apostate Imam’, talks of how every one out of four Muslims in Europe are leaving Islam. Once he reconnects, the first guest, Santosh Das, asks Narsinghanand’s opinion on धर्म परावर्तन (Dharam Paravartan or religious enforcement) through which Islam was allegedly forced upon others. Narsinghanand begins by saying that the disease named Islam needs to be removed not just from India but from the entire world (Tier 2 – 3.1) . He then goes on a rant about how Hindus need to become strong, without which they cannot win this ‘battle’. Narsinghanand also says that Islam has various countries, mosques, institutions and terrorist organisations to back it, but its fundamentals are weak. He then refers to the ‘data’ shared by the ‘Apostate Imam’ which proves that Islam was slowly vanishing from this planet. At the 1:16:00-minute mark, Narisnghanand says, “ Jaise swami ji China ne kaha ki Islam ek mansik beemari hai. Toh iss mansik beemari ka har sambahv ilaaj hume khojna padega, inhe khadena bhi padega aur inka paravartan bhi karwana padega .” (“For example; the way China has called Islam a mental disease, we also have to find every possible solution for this mental disease. We have to chase them away and at the same time enforce upon them our religion.”) (Tier 2 – 3.1, Tier 1 – 2.3) . For the rest of the stream, all the speakers continue talking about religious enforcement. At one point (1:17:05), Narisnghanand says, “Hindus never changed their religion on their own. I am not speaking of some of these traitors. Lots of torture happened, blood-bath happened, and rapes happened, but only after that Hindus switched their religion.” (translated) He repeatedly emphasizes in this stream that the reality of Islam needs to be brought in front of the world. His bit on this live stream ends with him talking about the various steps and sacrifices required to finish the ‘enemy’. Live stream #5 This one was held on a channel called ‘Maa Bharti Putra’, which is run by a follower of Yati Narsinghanand and has 2.76K subscribers. This live stream was organised on August 1, 2022, at 3:49 PM IST and the total lifetime views of this stream are 1,588 views. The topic of this stream was ‘Vishwa Dharam Sansad’ (Global Religious Parliament). The stream begins with (0:53-seconds mark) Swami Amritanand asking Narsinghanand about the topic of the stream. He asks why ‘Vishwa Dharam Sansad’. To this, Narisnghanand says that Islam’s jihad is not just an issue for India, but the whole world. He says, “Even the last Muslim on earth will take two swords in his two hands and fight until he kills himself. Islam’s jihad is endless, after the end of the world also they will continue their jihad.” (translated) He then adds, “So, Swami Ji, when they are our enemy, they are the enemy of Buddhists, they are the enemy of Christians, they are the enemy of Jews, they are the enemy of Communists. So we should all come together and fight them. This is the biggest battle.” (translated). (Tier 3 – 1) He further says, when the world comes together to defeat Islam, only then humanity will progress. Throughout the stream, Narsinghanand answers various questions. At the 7:30-minute mark, a viewer poses a question about the security apparatus of the country and how leaders have failed to ban PFI despite having thousands of evidence that they are involved in terrorist activities. What could be the reason behind this, he asks. Narsinghanand says that the entire world knows that no Hindu leader has the guts to fight Islam’s Jihad. He adds that there is no point in banning PFI as it will achieve nothing; the focus should be on defeating Islam and its jihad. Drawing on the metaphor of Cancer, he adds, “I don’t consider banning a step. All mosques and all madrassas should be demolished using cannons if you wish to survive. You are trying to cure fourth-stage cancer using prayers. That is not possible.” (translated) At the 14:40-minute mark, a viewer asks Narsinghanand a question about Hindus allegedly trying to please Pasmandas and Sufis. Narsinghanand responds by saying, “Do you understand cheenal women? Cheenal women are those who are not satisfied with their husbands. Sometimes they will go here, sometimes they will go there and then within a few days they die of painful diseases. Similarly, the Hindu community moved to Pasmandas. Sometimes they move to Sufism, then in a few days they join Wahabism, then Bareilvis, then you never know where. And then they will die a painful death, worse than that of a dog.” (translated). (Tier 2 – 1.3. Tier 1 – 2.2, 2.5) . In this stream, at the 28:53-minute mark, a viewer suggests that the leaders of Hindu organisations like Mohan Bhagwat should be converted to hijras (a pejorative term for transgendered people), to which Narsinghanand replies by saying “ Hijde toh abhi bane huwe hai, abhi bhi toh hijde bane huwe hai. Abhi kaunse mard hai? Dekhiye Satyam Shivam Sundaram ji, humara toh manna ye hai ki aaj bhi jo bade bade pado main behte hai sab hijde hi hai. ” (“They are already Hijras . See, Satyam Shivam Sundaram Ji, I believe, people who are in big posts are already hijras .”) (Tier 2 – 6) . A viewer also asks Narsinghanand about his opinion on India sending rations to countries like Afghanistan where Hindus and Sikhs are allegedly tortured. This is the last question in the stream and Narsinghanand responds by saying that Indian leaders have a tradition of treating Muslims favourably, like one treats one’s sons-in-law, and they have a history of dying by ingesting poison provided to them by these people. He says that an average citizen cannot stop this tradition. We decided to count the number of words that are common throughout these streams and found the following: Narsinghanand’s Take on Contemporary Issues Other than participating in YouTube live streams, Narsinghanand also regularly gives interviews to his associates and voices his messages on contemporary issues. For instance, he issued a video statement in June on the controversy surrounding Nupur Sharma, the former BJP spokesperson who allegedly made derogatory remarks on the Prophet of Islam. Narsinghanand had said that he would be visiting Delhi’s Jama Masjid on June 17, to tell the truth about the verses written in the Quran. [English Caption] Hindu extremist leader Yati Narsinghanand supported hateful comments on Prophet Muhammad, he said Islamic books are responsible for terrorism. pic.twitter.com/O4ZRYGRVM4 — HindutvaWatch (@HindutvaWatchIn) June 7, 2022 Narsinghanand’s video statement went viral on social media on June 7. The Ghaziabad administration later issued a notice to him asking him to cancel his Jama Masjid visit or face legal consequences. On June 8, he gave an interview to his associates at the Maa Bharti Putra YouTube channel. In this interview, Narsinghanand again spoke about his plans to visit Jama Masjid. He also repeats that “Islam is an organised gang of criminals.” [timestamp: 4:11-minute.] (Tier 1 – 2.6, 2.7) This interview received 8,050 views. On June 12, again on the Maa Bharti Putra YouTube channel, a video of a conversation between Narsinghanand and an unidentified individual was uploaded. In his signature style, Narsinghanand talks about Islam in a derogatory manner throughout the video. At the 3:40-minute mark, he says that “No one is scared of their threats. The Jews are not scared, and the Buddhists of Myanmar are not scared. In fact, China has declared Islam as a mental disease.” (Tier 1 – 2.3, Tier 2 – 3.1) This video received 12,729 views. Parts of the conversation between Narsinghanand and the unidentified individual were also uploaded on YouTube on June 14. Here, he continues to talk about Islam and about history. At one point [timestamp: 10:50-minute mark] he says that the Holocaust happened because Muslims had told the Nazis to do it. (Tier 1 – 4.6) This video received 8,298 views. On July 1, during the hearing of the plea by suspended BJP leader Nupur Sharma seeking the transfer of FIRs against her, Justice Surya Kant made an oral remark that “this lady [Nupur Shamra] is single-handedly responsible for what is happening in the country.” Responding to this, Narsinghanand issued a video saying that the judiciary of the country has instigated ‘jihadis’ to kill Nupur Sharma. At the 00:36-minute mark, he says India has 30 crore jihadis. (Tier 2- 3.1) At the 10:00-minute mark, Narsinghanand says that the Supreme Court wants to get Nupur killed. It can get me killed as well. (translated). The title of the YouTube video in Hindi can be translated as “Will India be now run by Sharia law.” The oral remarks made by the court received a mixed response from the civil society . It is for the courts to decide if Narsinghanand’s language qualifies as contempt of the court. On the evening of July 9, just the night before Eid ul Adha, Narsinghanand recorded a message saying that Muslims across the globe are praying for the destruction of Narendra Modi and the RSS. He also says that the BJP government has helped Muslims so much that all their struggles are over and now all they plan day and night is how to rule India and how to do jihad. (Tier 2 – 3.1) In the same video, he suggests that the leaders of India should take the road the leaders of Myanmar or China or Israel did. (Tier 2 – 3.1, Tier 3 – 2) On September 15, Narsinghanand issued a video message regarding the rape case in Lakhimpur where two Dalit minor sisters were allegedly raped by three Muslim men. Narsinghanand says that this act was done by the ‘Jihadis’ of Islam. In this video, he also says that the Quran gives Muslims the right to rape ‘kafir’ women and to make them their ‘sex slaves’ or sell them in the markets. (Tier 1 – 2.6) . Unlike his other video messages, this one was uploaded on a channel called We Support Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, which has around 2.15K subscribers. This specific video received 1,148 views. All of the above instances — be it a speech, a YouTube live stream or an interview — Narsinghanad abuses and/or insults groups of people based on their religion identity, and sometimes gender, and incites violence against them. Violation of YouTube’s Hate Speech Policy Almost all the videos of Yati Narsinghanand and his associates uploaded on YouTube violate the platform’s Hate Speech policy. The policy clearly states that YouTube removes content promoting violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on Caste, Gender Identity, Religion, etc., The full guidelines can be read here . The image above highlights several points that have been violated by Narsinghanand and his associates multiple times on YouTube. For instance, in the second live stream mentioned in the story, Narsinghanand’s associate Swami Amritanand says Muslims are worse than animals and their religious texts justify necrophilia. Throughout all the videos, Narsinghanand casually refers to Muslims as Jihadis. He also says that Muslims need to be sent to concentration camps like the way it is done in China or they should be treated the way it is done in Myanmar [referring to the Rohingya exodus]. In several of the YouTube live stream, he promotes the conspiracy theory that Muslims are planning to capture India or that the Kaaba in Mecca is a Shiva temple. In fact, in one of his video messages, he claims that the Holocaust happened because Muslims had instigated the Nazis and Hitler. All of these are clear violations of YouTube’s policy on hate speech. After Alt News reached out to YouTube , two of the above-mentioned channels — Maa Bharti Putra and We Support Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati — were taken down by the platform after a review. The third and the most prolific channel, Swami Armitanand Bhakti, continues to be available on the platform. The platform did remove at least six videos from this channel. Violation of Bail Conditions Though Yati Narsinghanand’s bail condition says that he cannot participate in public events that spread hatred between religious groups or give inflammatory speeches, he participated in two such events — Hindu Mahapanchayat and Una Dharam Sansad — just two months after his bail. In fact, he continued to make inflammatory remarks on YouTube which receive thousands of views. Moreover, in August, Narsinghanand called for the boycott of the ‘Har Ghar Tiranga’ campaign, the initiative launched by the Prime Minister to celebrate the 75th year of Independence. As per Narsinghanand, the campaign aims to benefit a company owned by a Muslim. (Tier 3 – 2.3) हर चीज़ में मुस्लिम ऐंगल क्यों जोड़ दिया जाता है? अब प्रधानमंत्री मोदी जी के ‘हर घर तिरंगा अभियान’ का बहिष्कार करने की बात करते हुए यति नरसिंहानंद सरस्वती को सुनिये…👇🏽 pic.twitter.com/uc2rW4K4XF — Ashraf Hussain (@AshrafFem) August 11, 2022 In mid-September, after speaking at a public event, Narsinghanand addressed the media and said that all madrassas in the country should be demolished using gunpowder. He also proposed that all the students in the madrassas be sent to camps to remove the ‘virus’ called Quran. He also says that the Aligarh Muslim University should also be demolished like madrassas. (Tier 2 – 3.1, 1.2. Tier 3 – 1) . “मदरसों और AMU को बारूद व बमों से उड़ा ध्वस्त कर देना चाहिए और उसमे पढ़ने वालों को डिटेंशन सेंटर भेज देना चाहिए”-यति नरसिंहानंद हरिद्वार कोर्ट ने इस व्यक्ति को इस शर्त पर जमानत दी थी कि यह भविष्य में इस प्रकृति का अपराध नही करेगा लेकिन माननीय यह तो अब बमों की बात कर रहा है! pic.twitter.com/UESIjTaxXZ — Zakir Ali Tyagi (@ZakirAliTyagi) September 18, 2022 In the second half of October, Narsinghanand issued a video message about the alleged gang rape of a woman in Ghaziabad. The case received extensive media coverage due to the brutal nature of the incident. In his statement, Narsinghanad not only made the false claim that a Muslim individual had raped Nirbhaya ‘most brutally’ in 2012, but also repeated the claim that he makes often, that is, Islam teaches them (Muslims) to rape the daughters of kafirs and the crime should be looked through the lens of the Quran and Hadith. The Ghaziabad rape case turned out to be false as per the police and they arrested the woman and her accomplices for fabricating the charges. Narsinghanand’s speeches continue to demonize Muslims and promote both structural and casual violence against religious minority groups. As noted by lawyer Shahrukh Alam , hate speech does not only refer to offensive or foul-mouthed speech directed at people. It is speech that can cause actual material harm through the social, economic and political marginalization of a community. Legal Opinion Alt News also spoke with a lawyer regarding Narsinghanand’s bail condition. The lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “Normally in a case, when bail conditions are there and the accused is subjected to those conditions, the police should monitor if such conditions are violated and the judiciary should take its course if the same is brought to its notice. And hence, in this case, if the accused has violated the bail conditions on multiple occasions and if there are proofs in the public domain, then the same should be brought to the notice of the police, who should bring it to the notice of the court.” Section 446A in The Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 also dictates some provisions regarding cancellation of bond and bail bond, which can be read here . Narsinghanand’s BJP Connection After FIRs were lodged against him in April 2021, BJP leader Kapil Mishra came forward and started crowdfunding to support Narsinghanand’s operations. ₹ 25 lacs almost collected for Swami Yati Narsimhanand Ji Click to donate now : https://t.co/8NqiC1TKz1 pic.twitter.com/tfMNaV5KW2 — Kapil Mishra (@KapilMishra_IND) April 15, 2021 While Narsinghanand has no formal association with the Bharatiya Janata Party, he has been seen in close proximity of BJP leaders on several occasions. It is pertinent to note that his mentor in the early days was the BJP leader Baikunth Lal Sharma, who had played an important role in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement . The relationship between the BJP and Narsinghanand soured in August of 2021 when a video of his went viral where he could be heard saying that many women politicians have been mistresses of at least one male politician. Several BJP leaders and supporters condemned the statement. In fact, the same Kapil Mishra, who had previously raised funds for Yati Narisinghanand, now said he had a ‘Jihadi mindset’. यति नरसिंहानंद की महिलाओं के प्रति सोच किसी भगवाधारी की हो ही नहीं सकती ये जिहादी सोच से बीमार कोई कुंठित आदमी हैं इस आदमी को महिला आयोग और यूपी पुलिस द्वारा गिरफ्तार किया जाना चाहिए ये माँ जगदम्बा के मंदिर में बैठने योग्य नहीं https://t.co/Q24TGRwy59 — Kapil Mishra (@KapilMishra_IND) August 28, 2021 According to this report in Scroll , Narsinghanand has both supporters and detractors among the BJP rank and file. Police Response Alt News spoke with SP City (Additional SP ) Dr Yogender Singh Rawat regarding the violation of bail conditions by Yati Narisinghnand. He told Alt News that all information pertaining to the matter was available with Kotwali Police Station. The very first FIR in the Haridwar Dharam Sansad case was registered at this police station. When we reached out to an officer at Kotwali Police Station, we were told that the police did not monitor social media and that if Narsinghanand had delivered inflammatory speeches in public spaces or on social media, FIR should be registered against him at the nearest police station. There was no direct response to what course of action the police were taking over the violation of bail conditions. It was surprising to see that police were not monitoring the social media activities and interactions of an individual who had been to jail for inflammatory remarks and have a history of disseminating hate speech/misinformation through social media platforms. The police conveyed a sense that it was not their duty to monitor such developments as it was not under their station’s jurisdiction. On April 3, 2022, just about two months after Yati Narsinghanand got bail in the Haridwar Dharam Sansad hate speech case on the condition that he would not deliver provocative speeches that can disturb communal harmony or take part in similar assemblies, Narsinghanand launched a vitriolic attack against Muslims at the Burari Hindu Mahapanchayat in Delhi and urged Hindus to take up arms against Muslims. Fourteen days later, he repeated it in Una, Himachal Pradesh. Here, speaking to the media during a hate-spewing assembly in which he took part, Narsinghanand said that Islam’s jihad would eat the entire country. Undaunted by bail conditions imposed on him, Narsinghanand has since delivered speech after speech after speech targeting Muslims, which received thousands of views on YouTube. Not only that, he has announced a three-day dharam sansad in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, from December 17, 2022. After the district administration denied him permission, he said he would hold it at any cost. The Supreme Court recently took a serious note of the ‘disturbing’ nature of hate speeches ‘against one community’ and asked police to take suo moto action in such speech cases ‘even if no complaint is forthcoming and proceed against the offenders’. Keeping this in mind, Yati Narsinghanand’s brazen and repeated violations of bail orders with complete impunity deserve to be highlighted. It is worth noting that the apex court said in its October 21 order that ‘any hesitation to act in accordance with this direction will be viewed as contempt of this Court and appropriate action will be taken against the erring officers.’ What constitutes Hate Speech? According to the United Nations, hate speech ‘refers to offensive discourse targeting a group or an individual based on inherent characteristics (such as race, religion or gender) and that may threaten social peace.’ It identifies hate speech as a ‘precursor to atrocity crimes, including genocide.’ The Law Commission of India had in March 2017 submitted a report to the Supreme Court on hate speech. On page 38, the report defines hate speech as an ‘expression which is abusive, insulting, intimidating, harassing or which incites violence, hatred or discrimination against groups identified by characteristics such as one’s race, religion, place of birth, residence, region, language, caste or community, sexual orientation or personal convictions.’ Readers can find the Alt News Hate Speech Policy here, follwoing which this report has identified and classified Narsinghanand’s hate speeches. The document has been prepared based on Facebook’s community standard on hate speech, which is the most detailed such document available publicly. Tier 2 of the policy considers the following as hate speech: Expressions of contempt (in written or visual form), which is defined as: Self-admission to intolerance on the basis of protected characteristics, including, but not limited to: homophobic, islamophobic, racist. Expressions that a protected characteristic shouldn’t exist. Expressions of hate, including, but not limited to: despise, hate. All of Narsinghanand’s public speeches documented below, offline or online, can be designated as hate speech according to the above classification. Who is Yati Narsinghanand? In January 2022, Narsinghanand’s father 83-year-old Rajeshwar Dayal Tyagi told ThePrint that Narsinghanand was born in 1972 in Hirnot village, Bulandshahr. His given name was Deependra Narayan Singh. He also described his son as a brilliant student who had received scholarships based on merit for studying food and chemical technology in Russia. A junior at the college, Arun Tyagi, revealed to ThePrint that Narsinghanand was very popular among the Indian student community, especially because of his culinary expertise and he had started a business providing tiffin services. According to the story, Narsinghanand returned from Russia in 1997 and got married. He had a job offer from Haldiram’s which he declined and moved to Ghaziabad and opened a coaching institute. Around this time, he came under the influence of BJP leader Baikunth Lal Sharma, who later became his mentor. However, it is unclear how Narsinghanand got associated with the Dasna Devi temple and later became the head priest. In March 2021, Narsinghanand shot to fame after he came out in support of two caretakers of the Dasna Devi temple who had been arrested for allegedly beating up a 14-year-old Muslim boy for entering the temple to drink water. At a press conference, he said that he had trained his followers to give a befitting reply to trespassers from a certain minority community and they were simply following his instructions. The Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad also had a poster in place that barred entry to Muslims. After the assault of the minor Muslim boy, this poster was replaced by a larger banner which read the same. In fact, this poster inspired Hindutva groups to put up banners at other temples and shrines warning Muslims and non-Hindus not to enter the premises. The very next month, speaking at another press conference organised by Akhil Bharatiya Sant Parishad at the Press Club of India, Narsinghanand made several inflammatory remarks against the Prophet of Islam. A number of FIRs were filed against him. The Haridwar Dharam Sansad From December 17 to 19, 2021, a large gathering of Right-Wing religious leaders, including some affiliated with the BJP, took place in Haridwar. The event was termed ‘Dharam Sansad’ or religious parliament. On all the three days, this event witnessed an extraordinary outpouring of hate speech, call for violence and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Videos of the Haridwar Dharam Sansad soon started circulating on social media. BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay was also an attendee of the event and had brought a ‘saffron constitution’ to Dharam Sansad. The police took cognizance of the videos and filed an FIR on December 23. सोशल मीडिया पर धर्म विशेष के खिलाफ भड़काऊ भाषण देकर नफरत फैलाने संबंधी वायरल हो रहे वीडियो का संज्ञान लेते हुए वसीम रिजवी उर्फ जितेंद्र नारायण त्यागी एवं अन्य के विरुद्ध कोतवाली हरिद्वार में धारा 153A IPC के अंतर्गत मुकदमा पंजीकृत किया गया है और विधिक कार्यवाही प्रचलित है। @ANI pic.twitter.com/0NLBwPqQhV — Uttarakhand Police (@uttarakhandcops) December 23, 2021 On January 13, Jitendra Narayan Tyagi, formerly known as Wasim Rizvi, one of the speakers, was arrested for hate speech. A video of the conversation between Yati Narsinghanand and the Haridwar Police during Tyagi’s arrest also went viral on social media. In the clip, it appeared as if the police are begging the mahamandaleshwar of the Juna Akhara to allow them to arrest Tyagi. Here, Narsinghanand can also be heard saying to the police that they will all die (“Tum sab maroge“).

Uttarakhand | Yati Narsinghanand has been arrested today, in connection with a case pertaining to derogatory remarks against women. He has 2-3 cases registered against him: CO City, Haridwar pic.twitter.com/mMs1YI6R9x — ANI UP/Uttarakhand (@ANINewsUP) January 15, 2022 After staying in judicial custody for almost a month, he received bail on February 7 in the Haridwar hate speech case and on February 14, in the case pertaining to derogatory comments against women. As has been stated earlier, Narsinghanand’s bail conditions included giving an undertaking that he would not repeat the same offence he had been arrested for or participate in any event that can cause enmity between communities. Burari Hindu Mahapanchayat Less than two months after his bail, Narsinghanand appeared on the stage at the Burari Hindu Mahapanchayat on April 3 organised by Seva India Foundation and other Hindu organisations, reportedly without police permission. In one of the clips available in public domain, he says that once a Muslim becomes the Prime Minister of the country, 50% of the attendees will have to change their religion. He further says that the Muslims in the country are not from Arab, they were once friends and family of Hindus. He also adds that 40% of Hindus will be murdered, and the rest 10% of Hindus will give away their sisters and daughters to Muslims and will either live in refugee camps or in foreign lands. Narsinghanand also urges the Hindus to be man enough to take up arms if they wanted to alter their future. The entire above speech falls under Tier 2 (3.1) as it is Islamophobic in nature. Besides, it peddles a conspiracy theory that once Muslims come to power, they will essentially exterminate the Hindu population. Moreover, it is a form of speech that could incite imminent violence or intimidation. Yati Narsinghanand is at it again, he asks “Hindus” to take up arms against “Muslims” while addressing a crowd gathered at the ongoing “Hindu Mahapanchayat” in Delhi’s Burari ground. “If you want to change the future, become a man,man is the one who has arms in hand,” Yati said. pic.twitter.com/ABuX2B58UU — Mahmodul Hassan (@mhassanism) April 3, 2022 In another clip, he says that those who are capable of giving birth should go now and give birth to children, and make the children worthy to fight. Yati Narsinghanand further asks “Hindus” to give birth to children and make them worthy to fight. “Only give birth to children, go now and give birth to children, and make your children worthy to fight,” he said at “Hindu Mahapanchayat” in Delhi today. pic.twitter.com/9CmvGMWP9a — Mahmodul Hassan (@mhassanism) April 3, 2022 Both the viral clips show a clear violation of the bail conditions by Yati Narsinghanand. In this same event, several journalists affiliated with Article 14 and Newslaundry were assaulted. There were also reports of the mob forcing journalists to delete footage of the event from their devices. Una Dharam Sansad 14 days after the Hindu Mahapanchayat in Delhi’s Burarai, Yati appeared in another Dharam Sansad, this time in Una. There are no publicly available clips to verify if Narsinghanand spoke at the Una conclave. However, he did speak to the media during this event. He said that Islam’s jihad will eat the entirety of the country and that the population of Muslims was increasing exponentially. He also said that the population of Muslims had increased in the hills and hence the crime rate had gone up. This falls under Tier 1 (2.7) of the hate speech policy as it generalizes Muslims as criminals and also peddles the theory that an increase in Muslim population leads to an increase in crimes. [Generalisations or unqualified behavioural statements (in written or visual form) to or about criminals (including, but not limited to, ‘thieves’, ‘bank robbers’ or saying ‘All [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] are ‘criminals’]’. Yati Narsinghanand was also a speaker at the Una Dharm Sansad. He said, “Population of muslims is rising” and stressed on the need for Hindus to produce more kids. According to his bail condition in Haridwar Dharm Sansad case, he is not allowed to take part in these events. pic.twitter.com/P6uHDnfr8S — Kaushik Raj (@kaushikrj6) April 17, 2022 Live streams on YouTube and the Doomsday Theory Ever since Narsinghanand got out of jail, he has taken part in several YouTube live streams. On going through Narsinghanand’s YouTube speeches, Alt News found that there are a few points that he makes repeatedly. One of them is the idea that ‘Islam’s jihad’ will destroy India. He keeps on saying that by 2029, India will have a Muslim PM and this will be the beginning of the extermination of Hindus. He also likes to harp on the string that Islam is a fundamentally corrupt and violent religion that believes in destroying others and Hindus should be prepared. Another claim that he makes almost every time he is at the microphone is that religious texts of Muslims, that is, the Quran and the Hadith, tell Muslims that they can rape, murder, loot people from other religions, or ‘kafirs’. The only way for the Hindus to defeat this enemy is by being physically prepared, giving birth to as many child as possible and pick up arms. He also often makes the claim that most of the religions of the world, if not all, are at war against Muslims. Moreover, all of his speeches contain loads of misinformation and conspiracy theories unsupported by any evidence, which function as a launchpad for him. Live stream #1 On April 3 around 2:30 PM IST, the same day as the Hindu Mahapanchayat in Burari, Narsinghanand appeared on a YouTube live stream on the channel ‘Swami Armitanand Bhakti’, run by Swami Amritanand, a close associate of Narsinghanand. The channel has around 20.9K subscribers and the live stream received 6,066 views. The topic for this stream was ‘Vijay ya veergati’ (Victory or gallantry). At the 6:38-minute mark, Swami Amritanand says that there is a latest government press release as per which it is said that in the last one week in West Bengal, around 800 bombs, 15 rifles and 150 shotguns have been recovered from a ‘certain community’. He then asks Yati Narsinghanand about the outrage that is caused when they speak of such facts. To this Narsinghanand responds by saying that the Hindu community only knows how to do politics to fulfil self-interest. The Muslims, he says, are doing their job with honesty, that is, they are following what the Quran says and not doing anything that is not mentioned in there, implying that Muslims are inherently violent and it is part of their religion. In this same stream, at the 8:53-minute mark, Narsinghanand argues that Hindus are not producing children, not becoming strong physically, and are not prepared for a battle. He argues that Hindus are becoming economically strong but there is no meaning to that. At the 9:20-minute, the co-host asks why the Hindu community does not come to his support. Narsinghanand responds by saying that Hindus are not interested in saving their sisters and daughters. They are only interested in watching their sisters and daughters get raped by Muslims and later get sold in the markets. He says that Hindus have a slave mindset hence they don’t come to his support. At the 14:15-minute mark, Yati compared Muslims to wolves/beasts. This part can be categorized under Tier 1 (2.4) of the policy — Dehumanising speech or imagery in the form of comparisons, generalisations or unqualified behavioural statements (in written or visual form) to or about sexual predator. From the 14:58-minute mark, they extensively talk about the kinds of people who are leading this country and are ‘fooling’ Hindus. Swami Jitendranand also raises the issue of the Government of India not providing enough security for Yati Narsinghanand. Narsinghanand says that the government is providing security to those saints who are leading Hindus to the den of Muslims to get murdered. At the 17:55-minute mark, Narsinghanand says that BJP-RSS are here to promote self-interests before Muslims take over and rule Hindus in 2029 (Intimidation). He says that after 2029, they are going to give away their sisters and daughters to Muslims anyway. (Tier 1 – 2.4) Narsinghanand ends his bit of the stream by talking about Maulana Tauqeer Raza, and how the person was not arrested despite giving out objectionable speech, he also mentions that even nationalist news anchors are saying that he spews venom. Live stream #2 The second live stream was held on ‘Swami Amritanand Bhakti’ in the evening of April 18 around 8 PM IST. This stream received 2,738 views and it is the lengthiest Yati Narsinghanand has been live on YouTube since his bail. This stream was held on the day Narsinghanand and Amritanand were returning from the Una Dharam Sansad. The stream begins with Amritanand asking Narsinghanand why the speeches at the Dharam Sansad are termed hate speech. Narsinghanand responds by saying that Dharam Sansad-like events are enlightening Hindus and this has rattled the ‘jihadis’. At the 17:55-minute mark onward, to a question asked by Amritanand, Narsinghanand says that as per the hadiths, a ‘kafir’ can be raped, murdered and even looted, none of which is considered a crime. He adds that wherever sharia is implemented, the murder of a ‘kafir’ is seen as a reward. He also says that wherever Muslims are in majority, Hindus are not even allowed to breathe. (Tier 1 – 2.6) At the 44:17-minute mark, Narsinghanand says “They don’t spare their own mothers, sisters and daughters” (translated) – (Tier 1 – 2.6). Just after this, at the 44:27-minute mark, he says, “In Bangladesh when Muslims go to rape Hindus, their mothers say go one by one or else my daughter will die” (translated) — (Tier 1 – 2.6). At the 47:36-minute mark, Amritanand says Muslims are more shameless than animals. He says that it is written in the Hadith that they can rape the dead. The rest of the stream till the end remains in the form of a Q&A. It is pertinent to note, throughout this live stream, Narsinghanand also targets the RSS-BJP. He thinks that the BJP-RSS speaks a different language when they are not in power and take a U-turn when they are in power. Live stream #3: The Interview The third live stream on the Swami Amritanand Bhakti channel was done on May 20, around 2:41 PM. It received a total of 10,171 views. Unlike the first two streams, this one did not feature Narsinghanand. Instead, another interview with him shot a few days back was broadcast. At the 7:15-minute mark, interviewer Sachin Tiwari asks Narisnghanand how Hindutva will emerge stronger and how Gyanvapi has become an issue these days. In his usual style, Narisnghanand starts by saying that Hindus are fools, he says “which Hindu did not know that Gyanvapi was a temple and not a mosque?” He then adds that which Hindus do not know that the mosque in Mathura, too, is actually a temple. Narsinghanand says that it is good that these places of worship are being returned to Hindus but the focus should not solely be on that. “Isse jyada humein dhyan iss baat pe dena chahiye ki Bharat pe Islam ke jihadiyon kabza na ho jaye. Pata chala hum kewal mandiron ki ladai ladte rahe aur itne dino main musalman jihadis pure bharat pe kabza kar le.” (“More than this, we should focus on the fact that India might get captured by the jihadis of Islam. Our focus will solely remain on temples and one day we will find out that Muslim jihadis have captured the entire country”) — (Tier 2 – 3.1). He says that the whole focus should be on creating a Sanatan Rashtra (Hindurashtra), and only then will Sanatan dharma survive. He adds, “Mandir banne chahiye lekin dekhiye sthiti ye hai ki agar musalmano ka raaj aya to ek bhi mandir yaha bachna nahi h, jo mandir aaj ke hai ye bhi nahi bachne hai. (Temples should be built but the condition is such that if Muslims start ruling this country, not a single temple will survive, and even those temples that were built today will vanish). (Intimidation) He also says that the religion of Islam was born to destroy Hindu temples. The first temple that was destroyed was in Mecca, the ‘Makkeshwar Mahadev’ temple [referring to the conspiracy theory that the Kaaba is a Shiva temple]. Narsinghanand adds that he cannot expand upon these topics because of the restrictions imposed upon him by the courts. However, he doesn’t relent. He immediately says that, “Humara bhavishya tabhi zinda rahega jab hum bachengay.” (“our future will only exist if we survive”.) He adds, “Pata chala hum toh mar gaye fir chahe jitne mandir ho jitne gaushalaye ho, jitne ashram ho ye kis kaam aane hai. Woh Jihadiyon ke kaam aane hai woh unhe masjid banaengay, waha apni aiyyashi karengay, apna maza lengay.” (“One day we will find out that we all are dead and all our temples, gaushala, and ashrams will be of no use. They will be useful to the jihadis, they will convert those places to mosques, they will enjoy there, they will take pleasure there”.) (Intimidation, Tier 2- 3.1) He also says, “Islam ke basic jo samjhiye. Aapka jo bhi kuch hai, usey cheen na, aap ki hatya karna, aapke maal ko ganimat maan kar hajam kar jana, aapki aurton ko ya to balatkar karke mandiyon main bechna, ya apni sex slave banake apne pas rakh lena. Ye islam ka uddeshiya hai. Isko samjhe bina, hum Islam ko samjh hi nahi sakte.” (“Understand the basics of Islam. To steal everything from you, to kill you, to take away all your belongings, to rape your women and then sell them in the markets or to turn your women into their sex slaves and keep them for themselves. This is the basic goal of Islam. Without understanding this, we will never be able to understand Islam”.) (Tier 2 – 3.1. Tier 1 – 2.6). The interviewer then moves to the other guests. At the 23:22-minute mark, Amirtanand takes over and starts asking questions to Narsinghanand about the ‘restrictions’ implemented on him by the courts. What Narisnghanand says can be translated as follows: “Look, this is true that the court has put such a huge restriction upon me and I will never be able to tell the truth about Mohammad which I had earlier brought before the world. Now I will never be able to tell that Mohammad was a thief, that Mohammed was a dacoit, that Mohammed was a rapist, that Mohammed was a seller of women, that Mohammed was a merciless killer, that Mohammad was the founder of organised crime. Islam is an organised gang of criminals”. (Tier 2 – 3.1. Tier 1 – 2.6). Live stream #4 The fourth live stream was held in the evening on June 19, on the same channel. The stream was led by Swami Amritanand and it featured Santosh Das and Yati Narsinghanand. The stream received 4,400 views and the topic of the conversation was “धर्म परिवर्तन एवं धर्म परावर्तन पर विशेष चर्चा” (Special conversation on religious conversion and religious enforcement). The conversation with Narsinghanand begins at the 1:09:00-minute mark with Das narrating a poem about religious conversations. Narsinghanand gets disconnected from the stream and another guest, named ‘the Apostate Imam’, talks of how every one out of four Muslims in Europe are leaving Islam. Once he reconnects, the first guest, Santosh Das, asks Narsinghanand’s opinion on धर्म परावर्तन (Dharam Paravartan or religious enforcement) through which Islam was allegedly forced upon others. Narsinghanand begins by saying that the disease named Islam needs to be removed not just from India but from the entire world (Tier 2 – 3.1). He then goes on a rant about how Hindus need to become strong, without which they cannot win this ‘battle’. Narsinghanand also says that Islam has various countries, mosques, institutions and terrorist organisations to back it, but its fundamentals are weak. He then refers to the ‘data’ shared by the ‘Apostate Imam’ which proves that Islam was slowly vanishing from this planet. At the 1:16:00-minute mark, Narisnghanand says, “Jaise swami ji China ne kaha ki Islam ek mansik beemari hai. Toh iss mansik beemari ka har sambahv ilaaj hume khojna padega, inhe khadena bhi padega aur inka paravartan bhi karwana padega.” (“For example; the way China has called Islam a mental disease, we also have to find every possible solution for this mental disease. We have to chase them away and at the same time enforce upon them our religion.”) (Tier 2 – 3.1, Tier 1 – 2.3). For the rest of the stream, all the speakers continue talking about religious enforcement. At one point (1:17:05), Narisnghanand says, “Hindus never changed their religion on their own. I am not speaking of some of these traitors. Lots of torture happened, blood-bath happened, and rapes happened, but only after that Hindus switched their religion.” (translated) He repeatedly emphasizes in this stream that the reality of Islam needs to be brought in front of the world. His bit on this live stream ends with him talking about the various steps and sacrifices required to finish the ‘enemy’. Live stream #5 This one was held on a channel called ‘Maa Bharti Putra’, which is run by a follower of Yati Narsinghanand and has 2.76K subscribers. This live stream was organised on August 1, 2022, at 3:49 PM IST and the total lifetime views of this stream are 1,588 views. The topic of this stream was ‘Vishwa Dharam Sansad’ (Global Religious Parliament). The stream begins with (0:53-seconds mark) Swami Amritanand asking Narsinghanand about the topic of the stream. He asks why ‘Vishwa Dharam Sansad’. To this, Narisnghanand says that Islam’s jihad is not just an issue for India, but the whole world. He says, “Even the last Muslim on earth will take two swords in his two hands and fight until he kills himself. Islam’s jihad is endless, after the end of the world also they will continue their jihad.” (translated) He then adds, “So, Swami Ji, when they are our enemy, they are the enemy of Buddhists, they are the enemy of Christians, they are the enemy of Jews, they are the enemy of Communists. So we should all come together and fight them. This is the biggest battle.” (translated). (Tier 3 – 1) He further says, when the world comes together to defeat Islam, only then humanity will progress. Throughout the stream, Narsinghanand answers various questions. At the 7:30-minute mark, a viewer poses a question about the security apparatus of the country and how leaders have failed to ban PFI despite having thousands of evidence that they are involved in terrorist activities. What could be the reason behind this, he asks. Narsinghanand says that the entire world knows that no Hindu leader has the guts to fight Islam’s Jihad. He adds that there is no point in banning PFI as it will achieve nothing; the focus should be on defeating Islam and its jihad. Drawing on the metaphor of Cancer, he adds, “I don’t consider banning a step. All mosques and all madrassas should be demolished using cannons if you wish to survive. You are trying to cure fourth-stage cancer using prayers. That is not possible.” (translated) At the 14:40-minute mark, a viewer asks Narsinghanand a question about Hindus allegedly trying to please Pasmandas and Sufis. Narsinghanand responds by saying, “Do you understand cheenal women? Cheenal women are those who are not satisfied with their husbands. Sometimes they will go here, sometimes they will go there and then within a few days they die of painful diseases. Similarly, the Hindu community moved to Pasmandas. Sometimes they move to Sufism, then in a few days they join Wahabism, then Bareilvis, then you never know where. And then they will die a painful death, worse than that of a dog.” (translated). (Tier 2 – 1.3. Tier 1 – 2.2, 2.5). In this stream, at the 28:53-minute mark, a viewer suggests that the leaders of Hindu organisations like Mohan Bhagwat should be converted to hijras (a pejorative term for transgendered people), to which Narsinghanand replies by saying “Hijde toh abhi bane huwe hai, abhi bhi toh hijde bane huwe hai. Abhi kaunse mard hai? Dekhiye Satyam Shivam Sundaram ji, humara toh manna ye hai ki aaj bhi jo bade bade pado main behte hai sab hijde hi hai.” (“They are already Hijras. See, Satyam Shivam Sundaram Ji, I believe, people who are in big posts are already hijras.”) (Tier 2 – 6). A viewer also asks Narsinghanand about his opinion on India sending rations to countries like Afghanistan where Hindus and Sikhs are allegedly tortured. This is the last question in the stream and Narsinghanand responds by saying that Indian leaders have a tradition of treating Muslims favourably, like one treats one’s sons-in-law, and they have a history of dying by ingesting poison provided to them by these people. He says that an average citizen cannot stop this tradition. We decided to count the number of words that are common throughout these streams and found the following: Narsinghanand’s Take on Contemporary Issues Other than participating in YouTube live streams, Narsinghanand also regularly gives interviews to his associates and voices his messages on contemporary issues. For instance, he issued a video statement in June on the controversy surrounding Nupur Sharma, the former BJP spokesperson who allegedly made derogatory remarks on the Prophet of Islam. Narsinghanand had said that he would be visiting Delhi’s Jama Masjid on June 17, to tell the truth about the verses written in the Quran. [English Caption] Hindu extremist leader Yati Narsinghanand supported hateful comments on Prophet Muhammad, he said Islamic books are responsible for terrorism. pic.twitter.com/O4ZRYGRVM4 — HindutvaWatch (@HindutvaWatchIn) June 7, 2022 Narsinghanand’s video statement went viral on social media on June 7. The Ghaziabad administration later issued a notice to him asking him to cancel his Jama Masjid visit or face legal consequences. On June 8, he gave an interview to his associates at the Maa Bharti Putra YouTube channel. In this interview, Narsinghanand again spoke about his plans to visit Jama Masjid. He also repeats that “Islam is an organised gang of criminals.” [timestamp: 4:11-minute.] (Tier 1 – 2.6, 2.7) This interview received 8,050 views. On June 12, again on the Maa Bharti Putra YouTube channel, a video of a conversation between Narsinghanand and an unidentified individual was uploaded. In his signature style, Narsinghanand talks about Islam in a derogatory manner throughout the video. At the 3:40-minute mark, he says that “No one is scared of their threats. The Jews are not scared, and the Buddhists of Myanmar are not scared. In fact, China has declared Islam as a mental disease.” (Tier 1 – 2.3, Tier 2 – 3.1) This video received 12,729 views. Parts of the conversation between Narsinghanand and the unidentified individual were also uploaded on YouTube on June 14. Here, he continues to talk about Islam and about history. At one point [timestamp: 10:50-minute mark] he says that the Holocaust happened because Muslims had told the Nazis to do it. (Tier 1 – 4.6) This video received 8,298 views. On July 1, during the hearing of the plea by suspended BJP leader Nupur Sharma seeking the transfer of FIRs against her, Justice Surya Kant made an oral remark that “this lady [Nupur Shamra] is single-handedly responsible for what is happening in the country.” Responding to this, Narsinghanand issued a video saying that the judiciary of the country has instigated ‘jihadis’ to kill Nupur Sharma. At the 00:36-minute mark, he says India has 30 crore jihadis. (Tier 2- 3.1) At the 10:00-minute mark, Narsinghanand says that the Supreme Court wants to get Nupur killed. It can get me killed as well. (translated). The title of the YouTube video in Hindi can be translated as “Will India be now run by Sharia law.” The oral remarks made by the court received a mixed response from the civil society. It is for the courts to decide if Narsinghanand’s language qualifies as contempt of the court. On the evening of July 9, just the night before Eid ul Adha, Narsinghanand recorded a message saying that Muslims across the globe are praying for the destruction of Narendra Modi and the RSS. He also says that the BJP government has helped Muslims so much that all their struggles are over and now all they plan day and night is how to rule India and how to do jihad. (Tier 2 – 3.1) In the same video, he suggests that the leaders of India should take the road the leaders of Myanmar or China or Israel did. (Tier 2 – 3.1, Tier 3 – 2) On September 15, Narsinghanand issued a video message regarding the rape case in Lakhimpur where two Dalit minor sisters were allegedly raped by three Muslim men. Narsinghanand says that this act was done by the ‘Jihadis’ of Islam. In this video, he also says that the Quran gives Muslims the right to rape ‘kafir’ women and to make them their ‘sex slaves’ or sell them in the markets. (Tier 1 – 2.6). Unlike his other video messages, this one was uploaded on a channel called We Support Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, which has around 2.15K subscribers. This specific video received 1,148 views. All of the above instances — be it a speech, a YouTube live stream or an interview — Narsinghanad abuses and/or insults groups of people based on their religion identity, and sometimes gender, and incites violence against them. Violation of YouTube’s Hate Speech Policy Almost all the videos of Yati Narsinghanand and his associates uploaded on YouTube violate the platform’s Hate Speech policy. The policy clearly states that YouTube removes content promoting violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on Caste, Gender Identity, Religion, etc., The full guidelines can be read here. The image above highlights several points that have been violated by Narsinghanand and his associates multiple times on YouTube. For instance, in the second live stream mentioned in the story, Narsinghanand’s associate Swami Amritanand says Muslims are worse than animals and their religious texts justify necrophilia. Throughout all the videos, Narsinghanand casually refers to Muslims as Jihadis. He also says that Muslims need to be sent to concentration camps like the way it is done in China or they should be treated the way it is done in Myanmar [referring to the Rohingya exodus]. In several of the YouTube live stream, he promotes the conspiracy theory that Muslims are planning to capture India or that the Kaaba in Mecca is a Shiva temple. In fact, in one of his video messages, he claims that the Holocaust happened because Muslims had instigated the Nazis and Hitler. All of these are clear violations of YouTube’s policy on hate speech. After Alt News reached out to YouTube, two of the above-mentioned channels — Maa Bharti Putra and We Support Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati — were taken down by the platform after a review. The third and the most prolific channel, Swami Armitanand Bhakti, continues to be available on the platform. The platform did remove at least six videos from this channel. Violation of Bail Conditions Though Yati Narsinghanand’s bail condition says that he cannot participate in public events that spread hatred between religious groups or give inflammatory speeches, he participated in two such events — Hindu Mahapanchayat and Una Dharam Sansad — just two months after his bail. In fact, he continued to make inflammatory remarks on YouTube which receive thousands of views. Moreover, in August, Narsinghanand called for the boycott of the ‘Har Ghar Tiranga’ campaign, the initiative launched by the Prime Minister to celebrate the 75th year of Independence. As per Narsinghanand, the campaign aims to benefit a company owned by a Muslim. (Tier 3 – 2.3) हर चीज़ में मुस्लिम ऐंगल क्यों जोड़ दिया जाता है? अब प्रधानमंत्री मोदी जी के ‘हर घर तिरंगा अभियान’ का बहिष्कार करने की बात करते हुए यति नरसिंहानंद सरस्वती को सुनिये…👇🏽 pic.twitter.com/uc2rW4K4XF — Ashraf Hussain (@AshrafFem) August 11, 2022 In mid-September, after speaking at a public event, Narsinghanand addressed the media and said that all madrassas in the country should be demolished using gunpowder. He also proposed that all the students in the madrassas be sent to camps to remove the ‘virus’ called Quran. He also says that the Aligarh Muslim University should also be demolished like madrassas. (Tier 2 – 3.1, 1.2. Tier 3 – 1). “मदरसों और AMU को बारूद व बमों से उड़ा ध्वस्त कर देना चाहिए और उसमे पढ़ने वालों को डिटेंशन सेंटर भेज देना चाहिए”-यति नरसिंहानंद हरिद्वार कोर्ट ने इस व्यक्ति को इस शर्त पर जमानत दी थी कि यह भविष्य में इस प्रकृति का अपराध नही करेगा लेकिन माननीय यह तो अब बमों की बात कर रहा है! pic.twitter.com/UESIjTaxXZ — Zakir Ali Tyagi (@ZakirAliTyagi) September 18, 2022 In the second half of October, Narsinghanand issued a video message about the alleged gang rape of a woman in Ghaziabad. The case received extensive media coverage due to the brutal nature of the incident. In his statement, Narsinghanad not only made the false claim that a Muslim individual had raped Nirbhaya ‘most brutally’ in 2012, but also repeated the claim that he makes often, that is, Islam teaches them (Muslims) to rape the daughters of kafirs and the crime should be looked through the lens of the Quran and Hadith. The Ghaziabad rape case turned out to be false as per the police and they arrested the woman and her accomplices for fabricating the charges. Narsinghanand’s speeches continue to demonize Muslims and promote both structural and casual violence against religious minority groups. As noted by lawyer Shahrukh Alam, hate speech does not only refer to offensive or foul-mouthed speech directed at people. It is speech that can cause actual material harm through the social, economic and political marginalization of a community. Legal Opinion Alt News also spoke with a lawyer regarding Narsinghanand’s bail condition. The lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “Normally in a case, when bail conditions are there and the accused is subjected to those conditions, the police should monitor if such conditions are violated and the judiciary should take its course if the same is brought to its notice. And hence, in this case, if the accused has violated the bail conditions on multiple occasions and if there are proofs in the public domain, then the same should be brought to the notice of the police, who should bring it to the notice of the court.” Section 446A in The Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 also dictates some provisions regarding cancellation of bond and bail bond, which can be read here. Narsinghanand’s BJP Connection After FIRs were lodged against him in April 2021, BJP leader Kapil Mishra came forward and started crowdfunding to support Narsinghanand’s operations. ₹ 25 lacs almost collected for Swami Yati Narsimhanand Ji Click to donate now : https://t.co/8NqiC1TKz1 pic.twitter.com/tfMNaV5KW2 — Kapil Mishra (@KapilMishra_IND) April 15, 2021 While Narsinghanand has no formal association with the Bharatiya Janata Party, he has been seen in close proximity of BJP leaders on several occasions. It is pertinent to note that his mentor in the early days was the BJP leader Baikunth Lal Sharma, who had played an important role in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The relationship between the BJP and Narsinghanand soured in August of 2021 when a video of his went viral where he could be heard saying that many women politicians have been mistresses of at least one male politician. Several BJP leaders and supporters condemned the statement. In fact, the same Kapil Mishra, who had previously raised funds for Yati Narisinghanand, now said he had a ‘Jihadi mindset’. यति नरसिंहानंद की महिलाओं के प्रति सोच किसी भगवाधारी की हो ही नहीं सकती ये जिहादी सोच से बीमार कोई कुंठित आदमी हैं इस आदमी को महिला आयोग और यूपी पुलिस द्वारा गिरफ्तार किया जाना चाहिए ये माँ जगदम्बा के मंदिर में बैठने योग्य नहीं https://t.co/Q24TGRwy59 — Kapil Mishra (@KapilMishra_IND) August 28, 2021 According to this report in Scroll, Narsinghanand has both supporters and detractors among the BJP rank and file. Police Response Alt News spoke with SP City (Additional SP) Dr Yogender Singh Rawat regarding the violation of bail conditions by Yati Narisinghnand. He told Alt News that all information pertaining to the matter was available with Kotwali Police Station. The very first FIR in the Haridwar Dharam Sansad case was registered at this police station. When we reached out to an officer at Kotwali Police Station, we were told that the police did not monitor social media and that if Narsinghanand had delivered inflammatory speeches in public spaces or on social media, FIR should be registered against him at the nearest police station. There was no direct response to what course of action the police were taking over the violation of bail conditions. It was surprising to see that police were not monitoring the social media activities and interactions of an individual who had been to jail for inflammatory remarks and have a history of disseminating hate speech/misinformation through social media platforms. The police conveyed a sense that it was not their duty to monitor such developments as it was not under their station’s jurisdiction. Whether police complaints/FIRs were filed against Yati Narignshnand in the area where he delivered his speeches can easily be verified through a simple Google search. We found at least three media reports about FIRs registered against Narsinghanand in the last five months. (1, 2, 3). The latest ‘probe’ against Naringhanand was ordered on October 9, when he made objectionable remarks against Prophet Mohammad and Mahatma Gandhi.",Kalim Ahmed,,,1

The ‘rate card’ has been making the rounds on social media for quite sometime now. Last year, it was shared by Facebook group PROUD HINDU with the caption, “Shocking document. Love jihad is real.

Moreover, it is the heart-shaped image at the top of the pamphlet that gives the most concrete evidence of this poster being a photoshopped one.

Tully was the bureau chief of BBC , New Delhi. He started his career in 1965 as the India correspondent for the global broadcaster. “Modi destroying termite ridden old Banyan tree” -Mark Tully on Modi Mark Tully the BBC correspondent for India for many decades writes about changes happening in MODI’S regime. In his Book “No Full Stops in India,” while discussing about change writes – In India change takes a lot more time.The birth will be slow and perhaps painful. I believe it could be the birth of a new order which is not held up by the crumbling colonial pillars left behind by the Raj but is GENUINELY Indian ; a GC modern order, but ”not a slavish imitation of other modern orders”. He goes on to say that – “For all its great achievements, the Nehru dynasty has stood like a Banyan tree, overshadowing the people and the institutions of India, and all Indians know that nothing grows under the Banyan tree”. As Mark said , Change will be slow and painful, therefore for someone who doesn’t read and makes judgement based on perception will for quite some time not be able to see the change taking place or will pretend as if nothing is changing. The way changes are coming in Railways, Power sector, Defense Production and in governance and at the same time accompanied by the resentment of the old forces indicate that the process of change has begun albeit slowly but firmly and is going to be painful. Let us not undermine the capabilities of this termite ridden old Banyan tree which will still try its best to stop any one growing to the extent that it may even turn the soil upside down before falling down. For a year or so we may witness more of Dadris, more of Kaniyahas, more of Owaisi style shouting but finally if the Society keeps its cool, acts maturely and continues to perform we will sail through and the old forces will die a natural death. LET ME ADD to this – every day the new stir media throws in your face is all doctored by forces who wish to topple Modi Govt as Modi has uprooted them and they are like fish out of the water. The time has come to continue to support the man and keep your faith intact and we will see new India for sure – bigger, better, stronger, corruption free , peaceful , prosperous than ever before with people having better quality of life.. – Mark Tully.

Facebook page Kashmir Xpress News , with over 4 lakh followers, claimed he is Dr Razdan. Alt News has received several requests to fact-check the video on our WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160). Misleading video The fact that this video has been shared with claims identifying the man differently is the first red flag hinting that the video is misleading. Alt News performed a keyword search using the names of the two doctors and learnt that Dr Udwadia is a Mumbai-based doctor while Dr Razdan is from Jammu. They are both popular in their fields. As per a press note by the Ministry of Culture, Dr Udwadia inaugurated the ‘Outbreak: Epidemics in a Connected World’ Exhibition in 2018. The presser addresses him as a prolific researcher and renowned physician. In 2016, The New York Times wrote a feature story based on his inputs. Similarly, Dr Razdan is a well-known neurologist from Jammu. In April 2021, news agency IANS quoted him in a tweet related to COVID infection. Alt News compared the image of the man in viral video with the images of the two doctors and found that they are three different individuals. The photo of Udwadia is from his Google profile , while the image of Razdan is by IANS . While the man in the viral video looks nothing like Dr Udwadia, there appears to be some resemblance with Dr Razdan. However, Jammu-based media outlet The Straight Line debunked this claim on January 9 and dubbed the video as a fake. Additionally, Razdan confirmed to Boomlive that the man in the viral video is not him. As for the claim that dried ginger can prevent infection from Omicron, the claim is scientifically invalid. Alt News Science editor Dr Sumaiya Shaikh and physician Dr Sharfaroz Satani explained in a sci-check last year , “There are no clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of dry ginger in viral infections. A pilot study by Stefano, D. et al. (2019) on 10 healthy individuals showed immunomodulatory effects of the combination of Echinacea angustifolia and Zingiber officinale in softgel capsules. They measured the expression of genes in white blood cells (cells responsible for immune function in the blood) of the volunteers and found that after they consumed these softgel capsules, 500 genes were differentially expressed (the process through which the genes makes proteins) in these leukocytes. All these together shifted the leukocyte activity towards suppression of inflammation (which is a response of the immune system). So, contrary to the claims of boosting, the immunomodulation in this study can be similar to the one directed by hydrocortisone administration, a steroid drug used to suppress the immune system.” Last year, Dr Faheem Younus , VP/Chief Quality Officer/Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland, also refuted that ginger can cure COVID. In a 2-minute video, a man recommends a “technique” to prevent infection from Omicron, the latest COVID variant. He recommends snorting dried ginger.

It said that the Baili Liujiang Sports Tourism Demonstration Base and the Yulong River Leisure Sports Tourism Resort in South China’s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region had been listed as national demonstration base for sports tourism according to the local Department of Culture and Tourism.

Responding to this, the Rajasthan CM says, “In all fairness, such remarks should not be made, because no matter what, Mr. Venugopal is our general secretary, and he said that no one would make any rhetoric. We want everyone to maintain discipline. We should only focus on one goal since the people of Rajasthan are suffering; people of the whole country are suffering. There is tension, violence, inflation, unemployment. On the one hand, Rahul Gandhi is out on the streets putting in great effort toward this walking 25 kilometers every day. Lakhs of people are walking with him. We want to mount pressure on the central government. After that, our target should be to ensure we form the government next time. This is our goal. We have introduced so many historic schemes in Rajasthan. The whole country is appreciating the schemes we have launched in Rajasthan. The whole world is appreciating our handling and management of COVID-19. Not only this, other countries believe that this superb management by the Rajasthan administration saved the people, whereas so many were killed in Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Delhi due to unavailability of oxygen. So we did a great job. Now we have set out on this journey on the back of all the good governance we introduced. Our only goal now is focusing on getting re-elected.” In other words, Ashok Gehlot spoke not just about the people of Rajasthan, but the entire country. However, that portion was left out to suggest that the chief minister was complaining that the public was suffering under his leadership. Alt News dug further to ascertain the context of Gehlot’s remarks on giving statements. We found that on November 1, he had shared the stage with Prime Minister Modi at Mangarh in Banswara.

It states that the land dispute between Satyadev and Motilal was being heard at a court in a locality of Kanpur Dehat. After a lengthy trial, the court ruled in favor of Satyadev, directing the police to demolish the illegally constructed house built on the land. Following the court’s directive, the police arrived there with a bulldozer. Meanwhile, Sameer and Karthik started throwing bricks and stones from the terrace of the house, seriously injuring a young bystander. A few policemen were also injured. Following this, the stone-pelting duo was taken into custody by the police. On October 18, police issued a statement on the matter.

He tweeted the same pictures along with the condolence message: Similarly, BJP MLA PN Pathak , former Uttar Pradesh PWD minister Chandrika Prasad Upadhyay , advocate Jitendra Baghel , BJP member of parliament Anil Firojiya , Congress MLA Indraj Gurjar , national social media in-charge of BJP OBC morcha Rahul Gurjar , national vice-president BJP OBC morcha Nayab Saini , BJP MLA Kedar Hazra , and many others shared the picture of a helicopter exploding mid-air. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Fact-check A reverse image search of the picture with the burning helicopter showed that the same picture had been used as a representational image for several stories reporting on helicopter crashes for several years. The Google image search result showed that a story from Kashmir had used the same image in March 2022, but with the disclaimer that it was a representational image. The reverse image search also showed two results, one each from Microsoft Bing and Yandex, which referred to a report on a helicopter crash in Alaska in 2021 which carried the same image of the burning helicopter. The Google search result also showed the photo was uploaded on istock and credited to user Giocalde. However, on Alamy , the image of the same helicopter in undamaged condition was uploaded in 2012, and the photo credit carried the full name of the photographer, Giorgio Calderato. Below is a comparison of the pictures uploaded on Alamy and used in various news reports: A set of characteristics can be noticed which distinguish the two images: In the explosion photo, there is a lack of consistency in the colour of the smoke. There doesn’t seem to be any significant change in the state of the helicopter, whether in the fan at the tail or the rotor. The two observations noted above point towards the fact that the viral image could be manipulated. Also, if one looks closely at the other pictures of the Kedarnath crash in the tweets where remains of the chopper can be seen, one can see that the body of the ill-fated chopper is blue in colour with white bands. In the explosion photo, however, the chopper is of metallic colour with a few saffron bands. Moreover, the tail of the helicopter seen in the crashed remains does not contain a rotor but the viral image does. Here is a comparison: In order to go to the bottom of the story, Alt News reached out to Giorgio Calderato, the photographer mentioned on Alamy. He confirmed having created the photo of the exploding helicopter using photoshop. “The photo is not real. It was created by me. It’s on sale for commercial purposes,” he told Alt News. On October 18, 2022, seven people on board a helicopter to Kedarnath were killed in a crash. The rescue and search operation was conducted by the state disaster response force (SDRF), which mentioned that the mishap seemed to have been caused by low visibility due to fog. Soon after the incident, news of it and condolence messages became viral on social media. Most of the tweets carried three pictures. One of the widely-shared images was that of a helicopter exploding mid-air. Hastinapur MLA Dinesh Karthik‘s tweet carried the photos along with the message, which can be translated to English as: The news of pilgrim casualties in the helicopter crash en-route Baba Kedarnath Dham is very distressing.

He tweeted the same pictures along with the condolence message: Similarly, BJP MLA PN Pathak, former Uttar Pradesh PWD minister Chandrika Prasad Upadhyay, advocate Jitendra Baghel, BJP member of parliament Anil Firojiya, Congress MLA Indraj Gurjar, national social media in-charge of BJP OBC morcha Rahul Gurjar, national vice-president BJP OBC morcha Nayab Saini, BJP MLA Kedar Hazra, and many others shared the picture of a helicopter exploding mid-air. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Fact-check A reverse image search of the picture with the burning helicopter showed that the same picture had been used as a representational image for several stories reporting on helicopter crashes for several years. The Google image search result showed that a story from Kashmir had used the same image in March 2022, but with the disclaimer that it was a representational image. The reverse image search also showed two results, one each from Microsoft Bing and Yandex, which referred to a report on a helicopter crash in Alaska in 2021 which carried the same image of the burning helicopter. The Google search result also showed the photo was uploaded on istock and credited to user Giocalde. However, on Alamy, the image of the same helicopter in undamaged condition was uploaded in 2012, and the photo credit carried the full name of the photographer, Giorgio Calderato. Below is a comparison of the pictures uploaded on Alamy and used in various news reports: A set of characteristics can be noticed which distinguish the two images: In the explosion photo, there is a lack of consistency in the colour of the smoke. There doesn’t seem to be any significant change in the state of the helicopter, whether in the fan at the tail or the rotor. The two observations noted above point towards the fact that the viral image could be manipulated. Also, if one looks closely at the other pictures of the Kedarnath crash in the tweets where remains of the chopper can be seen, one can see that the body of the ill-fated chopper is blue in colour with white bands. In the explosion photo, however, the chopper is of metallic colour with a few saffron bands. Moreover, the tail of the helicopter seen in the crashed remains does not contain a rotor but the viral image does. Here is a comparison: In order to go to the bottom of the story, Alt News reached out to Giorgio Calderato, the photographer mentioned on Alamy. He confirmed having created the photo of the exploding helicopter using photoshop. “The photo is not real. It was created by me. It’s on sale for commercial purposes,” he told Alt News. Hence, it can be said that the image of the helicopter ablaze mid-air is not that of the crashed chopper carrying pilgrims to Kedarnath. It is an old stock photo used multiple times for representational purposes.",Mahaprajna Nayak,False,False,1

After examining the interview in its entirety, Alt News can confirm that the claim made by the Congress accompanying the video is completely misleading. Readers who watch the video themselves will find that Eknath Shinde has answered Nana Patekar’s questions multiple times. However, we will focus on the portion of the interview featured in the clip in circulation. The moment in the viral video can be seen from the 39:55-mark in the longer video. Furthermore, at the 40:06 mark , Devendra Fadnavis answers himself, interrupting Eknath Shinde. However, in order to understand the full context of the entire conversation, we request readers to watch the interview from the 37:42 mark onward. In this time frame, Shinde is questioned about the abundance of potholes in Mumbai despite it being the financial capital of the country. At the 38:15 mark in the video given below, Eknath Shinde replies, “This is a very relevant question because people in Mumbai have been suffering due to these potholes for the last several years. They also claim that there are a lot of potholes, figures like 1,000 out of 3,000 potholes in the city have been repaired. The media also covers everything. But I will tell you about what happened when our government came to power. I called commissioner Chahal and asked him how many kilometers of road there was. He said 1900 kilometers. I asked him why there were so many potholes, and if it was a financial issue. He said they had the money. I asked why they didn’t repair the roads with concrete. He said they repaired 50 km of road every year. Every year potholes form on asphalt roads. I asked, do you work for the contractors? He said no. I asked him how much money it would take to build 500 km of road in concrete. He said Rs. 5,500 crore and asked if he could borrow the amount. He informed me that they arranged concrete for 450 km of road, and even the tender process had commenced. I asked when they would complete the rest of the road. I told them to release the remaining tenders by March, and asked if they had the funds to do so. He told me they did and assured me there would not be a single pothole in all of Mumbai in the next two years, as all the roads would be repaired with concrete…” This response is followed by the portion of the interview in which Nana Patekar asks the question and Devendra Fadnavis answers while interrupting Shinde. After watching the entire interview, it becomes clear that Eknath Shinde did, in fact, respond to the question and took around two minutes to do so. It was later on that Devendra Fadnavis himself took over. A 19-second video clip of actor Nana Patekar interviewing Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde and deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is being widely shared on social media. In the video, Patekar asks, “Whoever is getting the tender, whoever the contractor is, take it in writing from them for five years.” Responding to this, Eknath Shinde says, “That stipulation has already been added, that too is…” However, Devendra Fadnavis interjects at this point and says, “What the CM said, and you asked a very good question.” The viral video also features Marathi text on the screen. The text on the top reads, “Fadnavis does not allow me to speak in the Assembly, Mahajan does not allow me to speak in front of reporters”. At the same time, the translation of the bottom text is, “Do you bring the chief minister along just for show?” Maharashtra Congress shared the clip and wrote, “Is Shinde a chief minister or a showpiece?” (Archived link) शिंदे मुख्यमंत्री आहेत की शो-पीस? pic.twitter.com/OQem0xaqMo — Maharashtra Congress (@INCMaharashtra) October 13, 2022 The Indian National Congress Maharashtra handle also posted the video with this message.

However, after watching the entire interview, it becomes evident that Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde spoke for two minutes in response to a question on the poor condition of roads in Mumbai.",Kinjal,False,False,1

It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021 , which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch . However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed on a black stone is viral on social media. It is claimed that this stone was found in Afghanistan. Viral messages claim that though the stone is cool from the outside, it can melt anything made of steel and iron when placed in contact. Twitter user @kabirkhan488 shared the clip with the same claim.

The image has been shared on WhatsApp with the text, “Everything is pre-planned. The only mistake is that this variant comes six months before, actually it’s planned in may 2022 [sic]”. False claim In May , WHO assigned Greek alphabets for key variants of SARS-CoV-2 for ease of communication. A few weeks later, the viral image started circulating online. This graphic lists all Greek alphabets from ‘Delta’ to ‘Omega’ under the variants column. Each ‘variant’ is assigned a month starting from June 2021 to February 2023. As per the graphic, the Delta variant was due to launch in June 2021. However, the Delta variant was first identified in India in October 2020 . As per WHO , Delta was designated as a variant of concern in April 2021 and as of today, there are five variants of concern — Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. In order to understand the mutation better, Alt News spoke with Gyaneshwer Chaubey , a Banaras Hindu University professor at Cytogenetics Lab, Department of Zoology. He said, “SARS-CoV-2 replicates after entering into the human body. However, the mutation is a random process. Therefore, theoretically, there are many variants. However, only a few are identified as a variant of concern. The idea that someone can predict the arrival of next variant along with time is impossible.” Alt News Science editor Sumaiya Shaikh also explained, “Variants are formed out of mutations that occur randomly due to replication of the virus. The higher the number of times the virus replicates in a body, the greater the chances of mutations. But these are random events. Sometimes the virus creates a better version of itself and then that becomes the dominant version. Like the Delta variant. But there is no way to predict what variants will be produced or what mutations will occur. This chart is unscientific because it is predicting the future of random events which may create a mutation beneficial to the virus. No one can predict that. Our cells also divide and sometimes during that replication, we create a random mutation, similar to a spelling mistake, which survives the replication process and increases its numbers. That’s how tumours are created. Sometimes such tumours can be highly carcinogenic (cancerous) and replicated elsewhere because the mutation is fast replicating and malignant. Some of these can be also induced by the environmental impact.” The claim was earlier debunked by Reuters . WEF, the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation — all confirmed this document is unrelated to their organisations. John Hopkins University did not immediately respond to Reuters for comment. Peter Vanham, Head of Communications at the Chairman’s Office of the World Economic Forum, told Reuters via email, “This is a fake document and has nothing to do with the World Economic Forum.” Several social media users have shared an image that shows two columns — ‘Cepa/variante’ (Spanish for strain/variant) and ‘lanzamiento’ (Spanish for launching). The first column lists 22 Greek alphabets starting from the fourth alphabet ‘Delta’ while the other column lists the date (month/year) from June 2021 onwards. On the right side, we can see the logos of Johns Hopkins University, the World Economic Forum and the World Health Organisation. As per this image, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was due in May 2022. Netizens across the world have circulated this image and insinuated that the pandemic is a pre-planned conspiracy.

Please refrain from buying and eating bananas these days, or if you do buy, be sure to open them inside. Watch the video] FACT-CHECK Did Somalia export 500 tonnes of banana to India? Bananas are indeed exported by Somalia. SOMINVEST , an Investment Promotion Office under the Government of Somalia, states that investment in Bananas has a high rate of return. Earlier this year SOMIVEST tweeted , “Somalia Banana was the most significant export crop to the world, becoming a global brand.” However, the largest consignment of bananas exported from Somalia, Alt News could find as per media reports, was 17 tonnes in 2020 to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. There are no reports that establish that 500 tonnes of Bananas were exported to India. Further, as per data by India’s Department of Commerce on Imports from Somalia, India doesn’t import bananas. Is Helicobacter is a poisonous worm? As per Cancer[dot]gov , the website for the National Cancer Institute — US government’s principal agency for cancer research — Helicobacter pylori is a type of bacterium that causes inflammation and ulcers in the stomach or small intestine. This bacteria was discovered by Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren and they received a Nobel Prize for their discovery of Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in 2005. As per the Nobel Prize press release , it is also defined as a bacterium — they are too small to be seen with the naked eye . Alt News spoke with Pune-based gastroenterologist Dr Prasad Bhate and he said, “Helicobacter can lead to stomach cancer which can be fatal. However, this fatality is never triggered in a matter of hours. It typically takes months or years depending on the complex interaction between host and bacterial in the development of gastrointestinal pathology.” To sum it up, Helicobacter is not a poisonous worm. Statement from National Research Centre for Banana In order to understand the deficiency in the bananas shown in the video, Alt News sent a query, along with the viral video, to the National Research Centre for Banana based in Tamil Nadu. “In this video worm-like threads having no features of worm except the shape are being pulled out of fully ripe banana and termed “Helicobacter” which cannot be seen by the naked eye. The bacterium has to be isolated, stained and observed under the microscope. Moreover, no such worms are recorded to infect an intact banana. Another fact is that India does not import any bananas from Somalia.” Prior to our fact-check, UAE-based media outlet, BARQ shared a statement by Abu Dhabi Agriculture & Food Safety Authority refuting the claim.

It is a seasonal virus and patients don&#039;t need to isolate,"The complete message reads in Hindi, “ब्रेकिंग न्यूज़: डबल्यू.एच.ओ ने अपनी गलती मानी पूरी तरह से यू-टर्न लेते हुए कहा है कि कोरोना एक सीजननल वायरस है यह मौसम बदलाव के दौरान होने वाला खांसी जुकाम गला दर्द है इससे घबराने की जरूरत नहीं. डब्ल्यू.एच.ओ अब कहता है कि कोरोना रोगी को न तो अलग रहने की जरूरत है और न ही जनता को सोशल डिस्टेंसिंग की जरूरत है। यह एक मरीज से दुसरे व्यक्ति में भी संचारित नहीं होता। देखिये WHO की प्रैस कांफ्रेंस.” It says that the WHO has said that COVID is a seasonal virus and has asked coronavirus patients to not isolate since they cannot transmit the infection. It has been circulating since last year. #BreakingNews: WHO has completely taken a U-turn and now says that Corona patient neither needs to be isolated, nor quarantined, nor needs social Distancing, and it cannot even transmit from one patient to another Posted by Muskan Suppliers on Tuesday, 27 October 2020 Alt News has received numerous requests on its WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160) to fact-check the video. The video had also been shared with another message that identifies the panel as a “group of European doctors”. Breaking news: Group of European doctors have taken a U-turn and now says that Corona patient neither needs to be isolated, nor quarantined, nor needs social Distancing, and it cannot even transmit from one patient to another pic.twitter.com/crwQV9LeAl — Akash RSS (@Satynistha) October 23, 2020 Claims: 1. WHO has taken a complete U-turn and now says that coronavirus patients neither need to be isolated nor quarantined. They also don’t need social distancing 2. We don’t have a medical pandemic or epidemic. 3 Coronavirus is a normal flu virus. 4. Panic is created by false-positive PCR tests. 89% to 94% of those PCR tests are false positives. They don’t test for COVID-19 and the rest are false negatives. 5. Up until April 2020 there was zero death in Ireland. In the whole country in 2020, there were 98 deaths out of 5 million people. 6. Masks are unnecessary and infringe on constitutional rights. 7. COVID-19 does not require people to get vaccinated Verdict: False Fact-check: 1. The video does not show WHO panellists. The international agency advises isolation for COVID-19 patients. The video begins with a woman identifying herself as Elke De Kerke, a general practitioner representing the Netherlands. She is the founder of ‘Doctors for Truth’. The panellists are a part of ‘World Doctors Alliance’ , a body that identifies as an NGO. It is infamous for promoting conspiracy theories on coronavirus and medical misinformation. British-Pakistani doctor Mohammad Adil had his license suspended by the General Medical Council of UK for claiming that the coronavirus pandemic is a conspiracy. The website of World Doctors Alliance claims that Dr Adil formed the organisation. Another doctor Heiko Schöning associated with the Alliance was arrested for speaking at an anti-mask rally in central London. None of the panellists are medical practitioners with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The claim that the WHO took a complete “U-turn” and declared that COVID patients needn’t be isolated or quarantined has been debunked earlier. [Read: WHO doesn’t claim asymptomatic patients cannot spread COVID, isolation is still advised] The WHO in fact said that even asymptomatic people should quarantine. “People not showing symptoms can spread the virus, whether they ultimately feel sick or not. That’s why wearing masks and keeping distance are so important in limiting transmission.” 2. The world is coping with a pandemic. The WHO defines a pandemic as the “worldwide spread of a new disease”. According to John Hopkins COVID tracker , global cases of the virus has crossed 172 million. A few small countries and island nations have remained free of the coronavirus mainly due to isolation which has had economic repercussions, but most of the world was coping with the pandemic and many are still experiencing devastating effects. 3. COVID-19 is not a normal flu virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, “Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.” The novel coronavirus is a new strain of the coronavirus family. It has unique characteristics and has never been discovered before. It has mild to severe symptoms and may also cause deaths for critical patients. Serious patients may need hospitalisation, intensive care, oxygen or ventilators to survive. As witnessed in the second wave of COVID-19 in India, thousands of people have fallen ill and died due to a lack of oxygen. The common cold, on the other hand, is not deadly. “When any of the coronaviruses (or rhinoviruses for that matter) cause the common cold, the physicians’ aim is to (a) stop the transmission of the infection to other people and (b) treat the symptoms. This is because the common cold is a self-limited disease – it cures by itself. It is for this reason, antivirals or antibiotics are not given for a common cold. In the usual clinical picture, it is also not required to find out which organism has caused the common cold since it has no bearing on its treatment,” Dr Sharfaroz Satani wrote in an Alt News Sci Check published on March 25, 2020. 4. Number of false positives/ negatives in PCR tests is exaggerated. The two most common tests to detect coronavirus are RT-PCR and RAT. The panel claims that 89% to 94% of those PCR tests are false positives. While there are chances of a false-positive result, the figure is highly exaggerated. Dr Niket Rai, MBBS, MD, Maulana Azad Medical College, explained in an article last year , “Specificity of RT-PCR to detect SARS COV 2 in swab sample from nose and throat is around 98%. It means that out of 100 samples in only 2 samples it gives false-positive result…it is not recommended to repeat the test when it comes positive.” CBC quoted experts who said that RT-PCR is not prone to false positives and is routinely described as the “gold standard” for a reason. Experts have been more concerned about false negatives. “A study last year found that the tests virtually never detect the virus on Day 1 of infection and tend to be at their best on Day 8, but even then there can be false-negative rates of up to 20 per cent. After Day 8, the study found the rate of false negatives increases,” according to CBC. While experts suggest that RT-PCR has a greater chance of giving a false negative result, the percentage is not as high as suggested by the panel. Dr Rai also explained, “Sensitivity of RT-PCR to detect SARS COV 2 in swab sample from nose and throat is around 85%. It means out of 100 samples, 85 samples give a positive result. There are chances that 15 samples may have the virus but not detected by RT-PCR (false negative).” He suggests repeating the test if a patient feels they might have the virus. 5. There have been close to 5,000 deaths due to COVID in Ireland. The panel claimed that there were zero deaths due to COVID in Ireland up until April 2020. According to the WHO’s COVID-19 dashboard , there were over 200 deaths in Ireland until April last year. As of June 3, 2021, there 2,61,872 confirmed cases and 4,941 confirmed deaths in the country. There have been zero deaths in Ireland in over two weeks. 6. Masks are effective to reduce transmission. Alt News Science founder Dr Sumaiya Shaikh wrote last year, “Coronavirus can penetrate through masks through tiny viral clusters as well as through the eyes. However, masks on an infected person can prevent water droplets with coronavirus from dispersing into the air. This air transmission is the main method through which the coronavirus or other viruses infecting the respiratory tracts are transmitted.” Read the WHO’s guidelines on masks here . CDC has advised that masks can be forgone by fully vaccinated people and US health officials have announced the same after the changed guidelines. While experts believe that fully vaccinated people are not considered to be major spreaders of the virus but the loosening of masks can attract irresponsible behaviour. For starters, there is no way to know who is vaccinated and who isn’t (as of May 19, 37% of the US population is fully vaccinated) and giving up masks may put the unvaccinated at risk before herd immunity is reached. 7. Vaccines prevent people from falling severely ill. The viral video was recorded in Berlin on October 10, 2020, when vaccines were yet to be rolled out. But it has now been a few months since countries have started vaccinated their citizens. Experts say that vaccines reduce the chances of infection or reduce the severity of the symptoms and fully vaccinated people are also potentially less likely to spread the virus. According to CDC , “COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness.” Gavi also says that vaccines reduce transmission but studies are ongoing to “understand how long vaccine immunity is likely to last, and if and when booster shots will be required”. Responsible behaviour is still advised to protect those who haven’t been immunised. A video of a group of panellists claiming that the world is not facing a coronavirus pandemic is widespread on social media platforms. “WHO has completely taken a U-turn and now says that Corona patient neither needs to be isolated, nor quarantined, nor needs social Distancing, and it cannot even transmit from one patient to another [sic],” reads the accompanying claim viral with the video. The complete message reads in Hindi, “ब्रेकिंग न्यूज़: डबल्यू.एच.ओ ने अपनी गलती मानी पूरी तरह से यू-टर्न लेते हुए कहा है कि कोरोना एक सीजननल वायरस है यह मौसम बदलाव के दौरान होने वाला खांसी जुकाम गला दर्द है इससे घबराने की जरूरत नहीं. डब्ल्यू.एच.ओ अब कहता है कि कोरोना रोगी को न तो अलग रहने की जरूरत है और न ही जनता को सोशल डिस्टेंसिंग की जरूरत है। यह एक मरीज से दुसरे व्यक्ति में भी संचारित नहीं होता। देखिये WHO की प्रैस कांफ्रेंस.” It says that the WHO has said that COVID is a seasonal virus and has asked coronavirus patients to not isolate since they cannot transmit the infection. It has been circulating since last year. #BreakingNews: WHO has completely taken a U-turn and now says that Corona patient neither needs to be isolated, nor quarantined, nor needs social Distancing, and it cannot even transmit from one patient to another Posted by Muskan Suppliers on Tuesday, 27 October 2020 Alt News has received numerous requests on its WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160) to fact-check the video.

WHO has taken a complete U-turn and now says that coronavirus patients neither need to be isolated nor quarantined. They also don’t need social distancing 2. We don’t have a medical pandemic or epidemic. 3 Coronavirus is a normal flu virus. 4. Panic is created by false-positive PCR tests. 89% to 94% of those PCR tests are false positives. They don’t test for COVID-19 and the rest are false negatives. 5. Up until April 2020 there was zero death in Ireland. In the whole country in 2020, there were 98 deaths out of 5 million people. 6. Masks are unnecessary and infringe on constitutional rights. 7. COVID-19 does not require people to get vaccinated Verdict: False Fact-check: 1. The video does not show WHO panellists. The international agency advises isolation for COVID-19 patients. The video begins with a woman identifying herself as Elke De Kerke, a general practitioner representing the Netherlands. She is the founder of ‘Doctors for Truth’. The panellists are a part of ‘World Doctors Alliance’, a body that identifies as an NGO. It is infamous for promoting conspiracy theories on coronavirus and medical misinformation. British-Pakistani doctor Mohammad Adil had his license suspended by the General Medical Council of UK for claiming that the coronavirus pandemic is a conspiracy. The website of World Doctors Alliance claims that Dr Adil formed the organisation. Another doctor Heiko Schöning associated with the Alliance was arrested for speaking at an anti-mask rally in central London. None of the panellists are medical practitioners with the World Health Organisation (WHO). The claim that the WHO took a complete “U-turn” and declared that COVID patients needn’t be isolated or quarantined has been debunked earlier. [Read: WHO doesn’t claim asymptomatic patients cannot spread COVID, isolation is still advised] The WHO in fact said that even asymptomatic people should quarantine. “People not showing symptoms can spread the virus, whether they ultimately feel sick or not. That’s why wearing masks and keeping distance are so important in limiting transmission.” 2. The world is coping with a pandemic. The WHO defines a pandemic as the “worldwide spread of a new disease”. According to John Hopkins COVID tracker, global cases of the virus has crossed 172 million. A few small countries and island nations have remained free of the coronavirus mainly due to isolation which has had economic repercussions, but most of the world was coping with the pandemic and many are still experiencing devastating effects. 3. COVID-19 is not a normal flu virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, “Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.” The novel coronavirus is a new strain of the coronavirus family. It has unique characteristics and has never been discovered before. It has mild to severe symptoms and may also cause deaths for critical patients. Serious patients may need hospitalisation, intensive care, oxygen or ventilators to survive. As witnessed in the second wave of COVID-19 in India, thousands of people have fallen ill and died due to a lack of oxygen. The common cold, on the other hand, is not deadly. “When any of the coronaviruses (or rhinoviruses for that matter) cause the common cold, the physicians’ aim is to (a) stop the transmission of the infection to other people and (b) treat the symptoms. This is because the common cold is a self-limited disease – it cures by itself. It is for this reason, antivirals or antibiotics are not given for a common cold. In the usual clinical picture, it is also not required to find out which organism has caused the common cold since it has no bearing on its treatment,” Dr Sharfaroz Satani wrote in an Alt News Sci Check published on March 25, 2020. 4.

Zydus Cadila, in its phase III clinical trial registry for Virafin, suggested it has shown statistically significant clinical improvements in phase II studies with COVID-19 patients. Since Zydus is marketing the drug for moderate COVID-19 and not for severe disease, the primary endpoint is reducing hospital time and increasing the recovery rate instead of mortality. However, using published scientific research, we will evaluate the impact of Virafin on mortality and hospital time in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, we will discuss whether interferons can mechanistically work against COVID-19. Claim: Zydus-Cadila claims that Virafin might reduce recovery time or hospitalisation period during COVID-19. Verdict: False Fact-Check: What is Virafin? Virafin (or PegIntron, Sylatron in the US) is not a direct antiviral but a biological response modulator . It is used as an antineoplastic agent (anti-cancer drug) and is administered subcutaneously (under the skin). This drug is a protein alpha- interferon-2b released from human cells and is known for its antiviral and anti-proliferative activity. This protein is one of the 16 alpha-interferon sub-categories, which have a high affinity for cell surface receptors. In Virafin, this protein ‘alpha- interferon-2b is attached to a polymer derived from petroleum to increase its therapeutic effect. The Zydus clinical trial of Virafin Phase II study: Pandit, Anuja, et al. “Efficacy and Safety of Pegylated Interferon alfa-2b in Moderate COVID-19: A phase II, randomized, controlled, open-label study.” International Journal of Infectious Diseases 105 (2021): 516-521. Zydus published a phase II clinical trial in March 2021 that evaluated the data for Virafin against 20 COVID-19 patients, and which was compared with Standard-of-Care (SOC) against a cohort of another 20 COVID-19 patients. After two doses of Virafin injection on day 1 and 8 in a hospital setting, only 1 out of 20 patients receiving Virafin was SARS-CoV-2 positive on day 14. In comparison, among those who did not receive Virafin (were on the SOC), 6 out of 20 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive on day 14. The number of participants in this study was deficient (20 in each group). Also, the study excluded all patients with comorbidities like kidney and liver disease and were all under the age of 65. Since most patients recover from COVID-19 on their own without external therapeutic intervention, it is impossible to show whether Virafin affected their recovery prospects, i.e., if they recovered on their own, especially in a tiny sample size of 20. Also, it is impossible to ascertain the 1st day of infection when the patient is hospitalised after presenting with symptoms . When the patient is first infected, it takes about 4-6 days until the first signs of symptoms of Covid-19 are observed . The patient is likely 6-8 days or more into the infection when they present themselves at the hospital. Thus, the endpoints measured on day 14 cannot be a direct comparison between individuals. Such effects can only be resolved with large data sets, i.e., studies with a sample size of 1000 or more patients. Secondly, the phase III data is not published, which is meant for a 250 patient cohort according to its clinical trial registry (CTRI). The CTRI also details the length of the trial, ten months from December 2020, which is estimated to be between October-November 2021. It is not clear when all the patients were enrolled and the actual study began. In the best case, even if the study enrolled all patients in January, one would just have data for just three months until April. Additionally, the patient cohort size for this Phase III study is also much smaller than what is statistically needed to identify any substantial therapeutic effect of the drug candidate. It is not possible to make a categorical claim about the drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy with this small patient cohort. Did Virafin reduce COVID-19 severity or recovery time in the Zydus phase II study? The inflammatory response that arises as a result of interferon alpha-2 is also similar to the cytokine storm inflammation of the interferon protein family that occurs as a result of the COVID-19 infection. Such inflammation in severe COVID-19 is the reason for tissue damage, multiple organ dysfunction, and in some cases, death . Nonetheless, in mild-moderate disease, repair processes are initiated as soon as the inflammation is triggered. Thus, the body’s recovery system is engaged in healing post-inflammatory processes. The question that needs to be answered is whether the data presented from the Phase II study, a study that screened out severe cases of Covid-19 showed no mortalities in both the drug candidate and the SOC group is due to the physiological action of the drug candidate, or a result of the body’s post-inflammatory healing process. Would the same effect be replicated in a large patient population, in both moderate and severe categories? Since the moderate disease patients recover independently without any external therapeutic intervention, it is important to control for this confounding factor during the study. Virafin may have had little impact on the recovery of the moderate COVID-19 patients, as its effect is primarily related to evoking the immune response similar to the cytokine storm in detecting viral antigen. However, the small sample size of this Phase II study does not allow us to answer this question statistically. Are interferons helpful or harmful for COVID-19 hospitalisation? Much of the research related to SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the pandemic was focused on the mechanisms by which the disease caused deaths. It is now undisputed that the cytokine storm is linked with extensive lung damage and deterioration during COVID-19 . Interferons are a type of central cytokines, and some of them, i.e. interferons- alpha, beta and gamma, are produced after a viral infection. These different interferons are produced by various immune cells to generate an immune response that results in inflammation, which also damages the organs. The figure above (Fara et al. 2020) suggests how various active immune cells in a hyper-inflammatory state can damage the healthy balloon-shaped alveoli of the lungs. Further, the general line of treatment and management in COVID-19 has been about prevention and management of the cytokine storm, not invoking it. Adding to the cytokine storm, drugs may cause more harm. For example, an immune-suppressor steroidal drug, i.e. dexamethasone, prednisone & methylprednisolone, are used precisely to suppress this hyper inflammation ( see figure above ). A significant amount of research , including WHO , has recommended the use of steroids in attenuating cytokine-storms with excessive interferon activity for severe COVID-19. What does data from other studies suggest about the efficacy of interferons? The following studies were conducted to ascertain if there was a possibility of using the body’s immune response to treat COVID-19 that doesn’t negatively affect the organ systems within the body. We will evaluate all those studies systematically here: Study 1: Zhou, Qiong, et al. “Interferon-α2b Treatment for COVID-19.” Frontiers in immunology 11 (2020): 1061. This study published in May 2020 was one of the first studies to show the impact of interferon-alpha 2b against moderate COVID-19. However, the patients receiving interferon were only 53, which was compared to 24 that received the standard care. Most importantly, the patients were not randomised in each group, and the time of hospitalisation from the onset of the first symptoms was the largest in the standard-care group. Thus, comparing recovery time in the hospital, the late hospital admission in the control group vs the interferon group was the obvious confounding factor and rendered the study futile. Study 2: Liu, Jingyuan, et al. “Comparative therapeutic efficacy of interferon and combination Kaletra plus interferon alpha-2b against SARS-CoV-2.” (2020). Another study tested the use of this drug was from China and recruited 111 patients for the treatment group and compared it with 12 patients of standard care. However, instead of measuring the recovery period or hospitalisation time, the study measured the viral clearance and oxygen requirement in these patients. The study showed no differences in the interferon-alpha 2b group as opposed to the standard care, indicating that in a slightly larger group, the slight chance effect of interferon therapy diminishes. Thus, in the light of studies 1 and 2 above, there is no evidence for any clinical benefits such as a viral reduction in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The data of reduced hospital period is frail and confounded with the unmatched timeline of hospitalisation in each patient. Why do in-vivo studies for the same treatment show a different picture? Although, mechanistically, the idea is based on the scientific rationale that interferon I (alpha and beta) response is suppressed during SARS-CoV-2. Also, that impaired or delayed interferon-alpha and beta responses add to the severity of the disease . However, the reason for efficacy within in-vivo preparations may be that the external dosing with interferon-alpha 2b manipulates a viral replication at the time it is possible. However, in humans, this replication time point is often much earlier in the disease history, i.e. when the symptoms are largely absent. Once the replication is over (1-6 days), the cytokine storm in moderate-to-severe cases produces respiratory symptoms and lung damage, leading to the patient’s hospitalisation (see picture above from Cevik et al. 2020 ). Thus, in the second half of the disease period, only suppression of the immune response via steroids, and other organ support, can help treat the damage by the cytokine storm. Administering antivirals or interferons after the viral genome replication period, i.e. during hospitalisation (days 6+), may not have any impact on the clinical symptoms. Conclusion: In the race to develop COVID-19 treatments, many drugs and vaccines have been approved at a faster rate, often skipping studying the therapeutic benefits in a well designed and controlled phase III study. In this case, interferon-alpha 2b, a repurposed drug from other diseases, has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) without robust clinical data. The DCGI has used the ‘accelerated approval’ procedure in the Second Schedule of the New Drugs & Clinical Trials Rules, 2019 for this approval. To secure approval under this pathway, pharmaceutical companies have to show that their experimental drug candidate demonstrated ‘remarkable efficacy’ during the Phase II trials for a disease that lacks alternative treatments and that there is a prima facie case of meaningful therapeutic benefit over the existing treatments. Neither of these requirements seems to have been met with this study. Given the small patient cohort for this study, it would be important to understand how the DCGI determined that Virafin demonstrated “remarkable efficacy” in this 20+20 patient study. Furthermore, even the projected sample size for Phase III as documented in the CTRI is not large enough to clearly answer this question. Pharmaceutical manufacturer Zydus Cadila got the approval of DGCI (Drugs Controller General of India) for a medication ‘Virafin’ to treat moderate COVID-19 patients. ‘Virafin’ is the brand name of Zydus’s Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b. First marketed as Heberon Alfa R, the medication was developed in 1986 by the Cuban Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology of Havana as a drug against viral hepatitis C and melanoma – a type of skin cancer. Since then, it has been used with other antiviral drugs or with surgical procedures in these diseases. Zydus has announced this development after releasing the news of another indigenous vaccine being developed called ZyCoV-D, which has allegedly completed phase 1 and 2 trials and is expected to be released in 2022. Zydus Cadila, in its phase III clinical trial registry for Virafin, suggested it has shown statistically significant clinical improvements in phase II studies with COVID-19 patients. Since Zydus is marketing the drug for moderate COVID-19 and not for severe disease, the primary endpoint is reducing hospital time and increasing the recovery rate instead of mortality. However, using published scientific research, we will evaluate the impact of Virafin on mortality and hospital time in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, we will discuss whether interferons can mechanistically work against COVID-19.

Thus, comparing recovery time in the hospital, the late hospital admission in the control group vs the interferon group was the obvious confounding factor and rendered the study futile. Study 2: Liu, Jingyuan, et al. “Comparative therapeutic efficacy of interferon and combination Kaletra plus interferon alpha-2b against SARS-CoV-2.” (2020). Another study tested the use of this drug was from China and recruited 111 patients for the treatment group and compared it with 12 patients of standard care. However, instead of measuring the recovery period or hospitalisation time, the study measured the viral clearance and oxygen requirement in these patients. The study showed no differences in the interferon-alpha 2b group as opposed to the standard care, indicating that in a slightly larger group, the slight chance effect of interferon therapy diminishes. Thus, in the light of studies 1 and 2 above, there is no evidence for any clinical benefits such as a viral reduction in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The data of reduced hospital period is frail and confounded with the unmatched timeline of hospitalisation in each patient. Why do in-vivo studies for the same treatment show a different picture? Although, mechanistically, the idea is based on the scientific rationale that interferon I (alpha and beta) response is suppressed during SARS-CoV-2. Also, that impaired or delayed interferon-alpha and beta responses add to the severity of the disease. However, the reason for efficacy within in-vivo preparations may be that the external dosing with interferon-alpha 2b manipulates a viral replication at the time it is possible. However, in humans, this replication time point is often much earlier in the disease history, i.e. when the symptoms are largely absent. Once the replication is over (1-6 days), the cytokine storm in moderate-to-severe cases produces respiratory symptoms and lung damage, leading to the patient’s hospitalisation (see picture above from Cevik et al. 2020). Thus, in the second half of the disease period, only suppression of the immune response via steroids, and other organ support, can help treat the damage by the cytokine storm. Administering antivirals or interferons after the viral genome replication period, i.e. during hospitalisation (days 6+), may not have any impact on the clinical symptoms. Conclusion: In the race to develop COVID-19 treatments, many drugs and vaccines have been approved at a faster rate, often skipping studying the therapeutic benefits in a well designed and controlled phase III study. In this case, interferon-alpha 2b, a repurposed drug from other diseases, has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) without robust clinical data. The DCGI has used the ‘accelerated approval’ procedure in the Second Schedule of the New Drugs & Clinical Trials Rules, 2019 for this approval. To secure approval under this pathway, pharmaceutical companies have to show that their experimental drug candidate demonstrated ‘remarkable efficacy’ during the Phase II trials for a disease that lacks alternative treatments and that there is a prima facie case of meaningful therapeutic benefit over the existing treatments. Neither of these requirements seems to have been met with this study. Given the small patient cohort for this study, it would be important to understand how the DCGI determined that Virafin demonstrated “remarkable efficacy” in this 20+20 patient study. Furthermore, even the projected sample size for Phase III as documented in the CTRI is not large enough to clearly answer this question. When most of the moderately ill patients infected with Covid-19 recover automatically from the disease without any external therapeutic intervention and that hospitalisation of patients occurs largely after the symptoms appear- which is also the period when the viral replication is near an end, it is not clear on what basis did the DCGI approve this drug for the treatment of this disease.

Alt News was unable to confirm the location of the image but it is at least five years old. The birds could not have died due to ‘5G radiation’ when 5G technology was not even introduced. Moreover, this conspiracy theory against 5G has been debunked several times in the past. Radiation from 5G cellular towers cannot kill birds Mobile phones operate in the high frequency (HF) range of the electromagnetic spectrum – from 100 kHz (0.1 MHz) to 300 GHz (3 lakh MHz), per the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). India follows ICNIRP guidelines and has one of the most stringent standards on EMF radiations. Airtel and Vodafone currently offer 4G in the 1800MHz and 2100MHz bands, while Jio uses a lower band of 800 MHz. The 2021 auction includes band range till 2,500MHz. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is in talks to open up new spectrum bands for 5G in the 3300-3600 MHz frequency range. All the above-mentioned frequency ranges are well within the permissible limit. An article in the BBC says, “The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low-frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells – unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun’s rays and medical x-rays.” American fact-checking website Snopes spoke to Dr Eric van Rongen, a member of the Health Council of The Netherlands and the Chairman of ICNIRP, after the rumour was viral in the country. Several hundred birds and sparrows died in The Hague between October 8 and November 3, 2018, which gave birth to the rumour. “The only way one could imagine the death of birds as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields is with very high-level exposure that results in considerable heating…But the levels that are used by mobile telecom antennas are not strong enough for this to happen. There are maybe millions of such antennas around the world and this has never been reported. Even if there would have been 5G exposure, it is very unlikely that that could cause the [bird] mortality,” Dr Rongen informed. The conspiracy theory that radiation from cellular towers cause birds to die was also circulating after 2G spectrum allocation . Birds, however, are known to die of collision with communication towers . Migratory birds sometimes run into tall towers that go up to the altitudes they travel. The steady red light on top of towers also confuses birds during navigation. A photograph of hundreds of dead birds has been shared with the claim that they died due to 5G technology. “I want to request the government with folded hands that please spare the lives of these birds who cannot speak for themselves,” reads the accompanying text.

Alt News was unable to confirm the location of the image but it is at least five years old. The birds could not have died due to ‘5G radiation’ when 5G technology was not even introduced. Moreover, this conspiracy theory against 5G has been debunked several times in the past. Radiation from 5G cellular towers cannot kill birds Mobile phones operate in the high frequency (HF) range of the electromagnetic spectrum – from 100 kHz (0.1 MHz) to 300 GHz (3 lakh MHz), per the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). India follows ICNIRP guidelines and has one of the most stringent standards on EMF radiations. Airtel and Vodafone currently offer 4G in the 1800MHz and 2100MHz bands, while Jio uses a lower band of 800 MHz. The 2021 auction includes band range till 2,500MHz. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is in talks to open up new spectrum bands for 5G in the 3300-3600 MHz frequency range. All the above-mentioned frequency ranges are well within the permissible limit. An article in the BBC says, “The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low-frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells – unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun’s rays and medical x-rays.” American fact-checking website Snopes spoke to Dr Eric van Rongen, a member of the Health Council of The Netherlands and the Chairman of ICNIRP, after the rumour was viral in the country. Several hundred birds and sparrows died in The Hague between October 8 and November 3, 2018, which gave birth to the rumour. “The only way one could imagine the death of birds as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields is with very high-level exposure that results in considerable heating…But the levels that are used by mobile telecom antennas are not strong enough for this to happen. There are maybe millions of such antennas around the world and this has never been reported. Even if there would have been 5G exposure, it is very unlikely that that could cause the [bird] mortality,” Dr Rongen informed. The conspiracy theory that radiation from cellular towers cause birds to die was also circulating after 2G spectrum allocation. Birds, however, are known to die of collision with communication towers. Migratory birds sometimes run into tall towers that go up to the altitudes they travel. The steady red light on top of towers also confuses birds during navigation. The claim that birds in India are dying due to 5G trials is not backed by evidence. The hoax was also viral after the release of the Tamil science fiction movie ‘2.0’ in 2018 that showed the effects of electromagnetic field radiation on birds. 5G radiation has also been blamed for the coronavirus pandemic.",Pooja Chaudhuri,False,False,1

Alt News Science founding editor Dr Sumaiya Shaikh and contributor Dr Sharfaroz Satani wrote, “The novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2) is transmitted predominantly by respiratory droplets, contact, and potentially by the faecal-oral route. After the virus enters the nasal cavity and pharynx (upper respiratory tract), it attaches to the outermost layer of the cells lining the respiratory tract called the ‘epithelial cells’ (see figure). The SARS-COV2 attaches to these cells via a protein called ‘Spike protein’ that attaches to a receptor molecule called ACE2 located on the epithelial cell surface. Once the virus enters these cells, it multiplies by invading further down the respiratory tract, lungs, digestive tract lining, blood, and from there on to the other vital organs of the body. Thus, throughout this process, the virus is multiplying inside a number of cells in many important organs of the body and the blood. Therefore, drinking hot water, washing it down, gargling or steaming with any other substances will not destroy the virus since it is not limited to the respiratory tract. Such home remedies may provide temporary symptomatic relief from a sore throat, but it doesn’t affect the virus or treat the infection. It is a complementary measure for common cold, akin to cold water sponges for fevers.” Neither can steam inhalation cure COVID-19 nor ‘Indian Air force Air Marshal’ Ashutosh Sharma at Bengaluru’s Command Hospital recommend the home remedy to defeat coronavirus.

Important Message for all The hot water you drink is good for your throat. But this Coronavirus is hidden behind the Paranasal sinus of your nose for 3 to 4 days. The hot water we drink does not reach there. After 4 to 5 days this virus that was hidden behind the paranasal sinus reaches your lungs. Then you have trouble breathing. That’s why it is very important to take steam, which reaches the back of your Paranasal sinus. You have to kill this virus in the nose with steam. At 50°C, this virus becomes disabled i.e. paralyzed. At 60°C this virus becomes so weak that any human immunity system can fight against it. At 70°C this virus dies completely. This is what steam does. The entire Public Health Department knows this. But everyone wants to take advantage of this Pandemic. So they don’t share this information openly. One who stays at home should take steam once a day. If you go to the market to buy Groceries vegetables etc. Take it twice a day. Anyone who meets some people or goes to the office should take steam 3 times a day. Steam week According to doctors, Covid -19 can be killed by inhaling steam from the nose and mouth, eliminating the Coronavirus. If all the people started a steam drive campaign for a week, the pandemic will soon end. So here is a suggestion: Start the process for a week from morning and evening, for just 5 minutes each time, to inhale steam. If we all adopt this practice for a week the deadly Covid-19 will be erased. This practice has no side effects & doesn’t cost anything either.

The radiation emitted out of the tower mixes with the air and makes it poisonous and that’s why people are facing difficulty in breathing and are dying. That is why we need to demand to stop testing of 5G tower and then all will be alright,” says the warning. (Translated from Hindi: “ ये जो महामारी दूसरी बार आई है जिसे सब कोरोना का नाम दे रहे है ये बिमारी कोरोना नही 5g टावर की टेस्टिंग की वजह से है टावर से जो रैडिकशन निकलता है वो हवा में मिलकर हवा को ज़हरीला बना रही है इसलिए लोगों को सांस लेने में दिक्कत हो रही है। और लोग मर रहे हैं। इसीलिए 5g टावर की टेस्टिंग को बंद करने की मांग करिए फिर देखिए सब सही हो जाएगा। “) The graphic further expounds on another theory and claims that radiation from 5G towers is affecting humans in a similar way how 4G radiation affected birds and sparrows and became the cause of their death.

An audio clip of a conversation between two men is also circulating on messaging platforms. In the conversation, one of the men reiterates the same narrative and can be heard claiming that 5G testing is the cause of numerous deaths in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharastra. He further claims that due to the elections in West Bengal, they did not initiate the testing from the state but instead opted to start from Mumbai, Maharastra. Audio-on-5G-testing-conspiracy The audio is massively widespread on WhatsApp. The screenshot below shows the numerous verification requests on Alt News helpline number (+91 76000 11160). Fact-check In the course of this article, we will discuss the following 5G testing in India Is 5G radiation causing the second wave of coronavirus? Did 4G radiation kill birds and sparrows? 5G testing in India The infographic states that 5G testing in India is the cause of heightened radiation which has led to the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. But 5G testing is still at a nascent stage in India. According to a report in The Economic Times published in March 2021, Bharti Airtel was one of the few telecommunication companies that started the development of 5G network technology in India through their own research and development in collaboration with local and US and Japanese firms using OpenRAN technology. Several other companies like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited’s application for 5G trials awaited clearance in March 2021. Moreover, it is noteworthy that countries like South Korea and Hong Kong with fully functional 5G have fewer coronavirus cases than India. According to the COVID tracking website Worldometers , the countries recorded 511 and 8 news cases respectively. Thus, there is no evidence to link the rising number of coronavirus cases and 5G networks. 5G radiation did not cause the second wave of COVID The claim that 5G network and not the coronavirus is making people fall sick has been circulating since March 2020. In February last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) clarifying on potential health risk from 5G said, “To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.” It is important to note that the USA’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), says that COVID is thought to have spread from person to person mainly due to close contact (within about 6 feet). “Infections occur mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets when a person is in close contact with someone who has COVID-19,” says the CDC. Moreover, the virus can also sometimes spread by airborne transmission. It can spread by exposure to the virus in small droplets and particles that can linger in the air from minutes to hours. On the other hand, mobile phones send and receive radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. Reuters reported that 5G uses beam-forming technology that allows radiofrequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where needed. Explaining the effects of radiofrequency, WHO wrote, “Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body. As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.” Speaking to Reuters , Professor Emeritus of Radiology and Medical Physics Marvin C. Ziskin said, “The weight of scientific evidence indicates that 5G emissions are not cumulative. That is, multiple exposures of innocuous exposures do not add to produce any adverse biological effect. I would add that there have been no health agency warnings about possible health risks of RF energy including millimetre waves at exposure levels that an average consumer would experience from communications technology. This is consistent with assessments of the issue by standards-setting groups such as IEEE and ICNIRP.” He emphasised that there is no basis to expect that 5G would cause adverse health issues provided exposure limits are respected. Death of birds and sparrow was not due to 4G radiation In January 2021, Alt News found that the claim that birds are dying due to 5G trials is not backed by evidence. An article in the BBC explained, “The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low-frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells – unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun’s rays and medical x-rays.” You can read our detailed fact-check here . Press Information Bureau’s fact-checking wing also rubbished the message that 5G radiation has caused the second wave of COVID-19 in India. A graphic demanding a ban on ‘5G testing’, claiming that it has led to the second wave of the coronavirus in India, is circulating on WhatsApp. “The epidemic, that has come for the second time which everyone is terming as Corona, is the disease due to the testing of 5G tower and not coronavirus. The radiation emitted out of the tower mixes with the air and makes it poisonous and that’s why people are facing difficulty in breathing and are dying. That is why we need to demand to stop testing of 5G tower and then all will be alright,” says the warning. (Translated from Hindi: “ये जो महामारी दूसरी बार आई है जिसे सब कोरोना का नाम दे रहे है ये बिमारी कोरोना नही 5g टावर की टेस्टिंग की वजह से है टावर से जो रैडिकशन निकलता है वो हवा में मिलकर हवा को ज़हरीला बना रही है इसलिए लोगों को सांस लेने में दिक्कत हो रही है। और लोग मर रहे हैं। इसीलिए 5g टावर की टेस्टिंग को बंद करने की मांग करिए फिर देखिए सब सही हो जाएगा।“) The graphic further expounds on another theory and claims that radiation from 5G towers is affecting humans in a similar way how 4G radiation affected birds and sparrows and became the cause of their death. Alt News has received several requests on its official WhatsApp number (+917600011160) to fact-check this graphic. This slideshow requires JavaScript. An audio clip of a conversation between two men is also circulating on messaging platforms. In the conversation, one of the men reiterates the same narrative and can be heard claiming that 5G testing is the cause of numerous deaths in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharastra. He further claims that due to the elections in West Bengal, they did not initiate the testing from the state but instead opted to start from Mumbai, Maharastra. Audio-on-5G-testing-conspiracy The audio is massively widespread on WhatsApp. The screenshot below shows the numerous verification requests on Alt News helpline number (+91 76000 11160). Fact-check In the course of this article, we will discuss the following 5G testing in India Is 5G radiation causing the second wave of coronavirus? Did 4G radiation kill birds and sparrows? 5G testing in India The infographic states that 5G testing in India is the cause of heightened radiation which has led to the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. But 5G testing is still at a nascent stage in India. According to a report in The Economic Times published in March 2021, Bharti Airtel was one of the few telecommunication companies that started the development of 5G network technology in India through their own research and development in collaboration with local and US and Japanese firms using OpenRAN technology. Several other companies like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited’s application for 5G trials awaited clearance in March 2021. Moreover, it is noteworthy that countries like South Korea and Hong Kong with fully functional 5G have fewer coronavirus cases than India. According to the COVID tracking website Worldometers, the countries recorded 511 and 8 news cases respectively. Thus, there is no evidence to link the rising number of coronavirus cases and 5G networks. 5G radiation did not cause the second wave of COVID The claim that 5G network and not the coronavirus is making people fall sick has been circulating since March 2020. In February last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) clarifying on potential health risk from 5G said, “To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.” It is important to note that the USA’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), says that COVID is thought to have spread from person to person mainly due to close contact (within about 6 feet). “Infections occur mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets when a person is in close contact with someone who has COVID-19,” says the CDC. Moreover, the virus can also sometimes spread by airborne transmission. It can spread by exposure to the virus in small droplets and particles that can linger in the air from minutes to hours. On the other hand, mobile phones send and receive radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. Reuters reported that 5G uses beam-forming technology that allows radiofrequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where needed. Explaining the effects of radiofrequency, WHO wrote, “Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body. As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.” Speaking to Reuters, Professor Emeritus of Radiology and Medical Physics Marvin C. Ziskin said, “The weight of scientific evidence indicates that 5G emissions are not cumulative. That is, multiple exposures of innocuous exposures do not add to produce any adverse biological effect.

https://www.altnews.in/gujarat-cms-understanding-of-icmr-guidelines-on-recording-covid-deaths-is-flawed/,Gujarat CM’s understanding of ICMR guidelines on recording COVID deaths is flawed,https://i0.wp.com/www.altnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/U4pigoSEfhQ.jpg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1,2021-04-26 08:02:35,2021-04-26 10:00:00,"Coronavirus cases are rapidly increasing in Gujarat. More than 14,000 cases are being reported in the State daily while the healthcare sector is overwhelmed with high demands it is unable...","Comorbidities like cancer or diabetes are the primary cause of death, as per ICMR guidelines, for COVID related fatalities","On April 15, Sandesh News aired a 50-minute interview with Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. This video has been uploaded on YouTube in two segments. In the second segment at the 14-minute mark , the journalist asked, “There is one question that I must ask, please try to answer this question with an open heart so that the people of Gujarat gain some faith…Taking the example of Rajkot, the death toll is around 80. However, the government’s official death toll is very low. There is a large inconsistency between the toll and what is being reported by the government.” CM Rupani elaborated on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines related to recording deaths due to COVID-19. According to him, as per ICMR, the primary cause of death of COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing diseases like cancer and diabetes is not COVID-19. Rupani said, “As per ICMR, there are two reasons for the cause of death. The first is purely due to COVID and the second is due to comorbidity. For example, a patient who is 75 to 80 years old has cancer in the third stage. Their immunity is broken and if they get COVID and dies, then the cause of death is cancer as the primary reason and COVID is the secondary reason. Patients with 500 points diabetes are admitted. Therefore, the cause of death is diabetes and COVID is the secondary reason.” He added, “Therefore, a doctoral committee is formed to audit each death. They distinguish the cause of death as primary or secondary. For example, if 100 deaths take place and only 20 are reported (under COVID), then 80 are due to primary reason (non-COVID) and 20 is due to the secondary reason.” Gujarat CM gave the same statement to The Times of India on April 19 – “The method of recording COVID deaths has been stipulated by ICMR and all states, including Gujarat, are following it.” COVID-19 deaths don’t add up in Gujarat As per The Quint and Gujarat Samachar , multiple dead bodies are being simultaneously cremated in the State. The Print reported that the death tolls at Ahmedabad’s six crematoriums were at least 84 on April 16. However, the Health and Family Welfare Department of Gujarat reported just 25 deaths in the city. A day prior to The Print report, The Hindu reported that on April 16 state health bulletin recorded 78 deaths related to COVID-19. However, The Hindu found that at least 689 bodies were either cremated or buried following COVID-19 protocols on the disposal of bodies. India Today also looked into the allegations that Gujarat is under-reporting COVID-19 deaths. According to the channel’s on-the-ground assessment, the “toll could be a lot higher”. Reports from Varanasi , Bhopal , and Telangana exhibit a similar pattern. What do ICMR guidelines say? Alt News studied ‘Guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India’ ( view PDF ) by ICMR and the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR) and found that CM Rupani’s statement is misleading. As per NCDIR director Dr Prashant Mathur these guidelines issued in May 2020. Page 3 states, “Patients may present with other pre-existing comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, chronic bronchitis, ischemic heart disease, cancer and diabetes mellitus. These conditions increase the risk of developing respiratory infections and may lead to complications and severe disease in a COVID-19 positive individual. These conditions are not considered as UCOD (underlying cause of death) as they have directly not caused death due to COVID-19. Also, a patient may have many co-morbid conditions, but only those that have contributed to death should be recorded in Part 2.” Mathur told Alt News, “Death of a COVID-19 patient with comorbidity, such diabetes, and cancer, can happen due to COVID-19 as the contributing or underlying cause.” He also stated, “Irrespective of the cause of death it is important to use COVID-19 related mortality codes on Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) forms to understand the impact of the pandemic accurately.” Expert opinion Alt News spoke to Associate Professor Chalapati Rao at Australia National University. Last year, he wrote a WHO editorial titled ‘ Medical certification of cause of death for COVID-19′ . After reading CM Rupani’s statement to Sandesh News, he said, “In the process of explaining the ICMR guidelines, CM Rupani used the phrases primary and secondary cause of deaths. The appropriate terms to be used are underlying and contributory causes, and these labels are assigned to causes based on their placement on various sections of the MCCD. For primary mortality statistics, the magnitude of mortality from COVID-19 needs to be assessed from the perspective of COVID-19 as an underlying cause. However, for monitoring the impact of the pandemic, all deaths with COVID-19 mentioned on the certificate, irrespective of whether listed as an underlying or as a contributory cause, are included for the analysis. Hence, the accurate listing and placement of COVID-19 on MCCD are of critical importance for detailed mortality assessment.” Rao further explained, “More crucially, if a patient has tested positive for COVID-19, then the MCCD should state it clearly along with the prefix ‘confirmed’ so that the State has accurate data and thus takes appropriate measures. Certifying physicians also have the discretion to record ‘suspected COVID-19’ on MCCD, if a test result was not available but the clinical picture was suggestive of COVID infection. The term COVID-19 should always be prefixed with confirmed or suspected, to enable accurate data analysis . ” Alt News has written to the Gujarat Chief Minister’s Office and will update the article if we get a response. In order to explain nuances related to documenting COVID related deaths our report is split into: Understanding medical terms related to death Death Certificate vs Medical Certificate of Cause of Death Process of recording death Case study: MCCD prepared by Shalby Hospita l Understanding medical terms related to death The guidelines by ICMR/ NCDIR define ’cause of death’ (CoD) as, “all those diseases, morbid conditions/abnormalities, injuries which either resulted in or contributed to death and the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced any such injuries”. It further adds that ‘mode of dying’ should be avoided as the cause of death because the former isn’t specifically related to the disease process. As per the guidelines abbreviations should not be used for the cause of death. Here are some examples of CoD – respiratory acidosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute cardiac injury. The following are some examples of ‘mode of dying’ as per ICMR/ NCDIR: Death often results from the combined effect of two or more independent or related conditions, that is, one condition may lead to another, which in turn leads to a third condition and so on. Where there is a sequence, the disease or injury that initiated the sequence of events , called the underlying cause of death (UCoD), is recorded and reported. ICMC/ NCDIR guidelines specify that UCoD is: The disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death. The circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the fatal injury. All the morbid conditions or injuries consequent to the underlying cause relating to death are termed as antecedent and immediate cause. Death Certificate vs Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) The readers should note that “death certificate” typically means the document issued by the Registrar as per the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 ( view pdf ). In order to obtain this, one must present a document for proof of death (MCCD or document offered after cremation), and other documents. For more details visit this government website . It this pertinent to note that the document issued by the Registrar doesn’t mention the cause of death. MCCD is the certificate issued by the attending medical practitioner who had treated the person during admission in a medical institution or in the last illness (prior to death) while taking treatment from a physician outside of a medical institution. MCCD is the process of recording and reporting death using standard Form 4 (institutional deaths) and Form 4A (non-institutional deaths) as per the rules of the Registration of Births and Death Act, 1969. The MCCD form contains two parts: Part I to record the immediate and antecedent causes (highlighted in red) Part II to record the significant conditions that contributed to the death but were not part of the sequence of events leading to death (highlighted in green) Thus, when CM Rupani mentioned primary and secondary causes of death, he was essentially referring to Part I and Part II of the MCCD. Process of recording death As per the guidelines, Part 1 should note the sequence of events leading to death. Line (a) is the immediate cause of death – the condition/disease that directly led to death/ that preceded death Line (b) notes cause of death antecedent (just after) to immediate cause should be entered Line (c) a cause further antecedent to this should be entered The guidelines further specify that only one ’cause of death’ should be written in the above-mentioned spaces. It also states that disease, injury or complication that immediately preceded death can be the only entry in the MCCD form if only one condition is present at the time of death. More crucially, the last line in Part 1 must list the underlying cause of death. It is the disease or condition that started the sequence of events between normal health to the immediate cause of death. Conditions if any, as a consequence thereof will be entered above it in ascending causal order of sequence. Part 2 should include all other diseases or conditions believed to have unfavourably influenced the course of the disease leading to death but were not related to the disease or condition directly causing death. The following image lists some examples by ICMR /NCDIR, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. As per WHO guidelines, COVID-19 deaths are recorded using U07.1 (COVID-19) and U07.2 (test negative but has symptoms, test awaited and test inconclusive along with symptoms) codes to distinguish the diagnosis based on test and symptoms. The readers can view the document by WHO here . Both these codes must be clearly listed on the MCCD. Multiple sample forms (Form 4/4A) have been included in the guidelines issued ( view PDF ) by ICMR and NCDIR. The following screenshots are of sample forms of two COVID-19 patients who had cancer and diabetes respectively. The guidelines are clear, if a patient is COVID-19 positive, it should be reflected in the antecedent cause of Part I (immediate and antecedent). The pre-existing diseases are recorded in Part II (significant conditions that contributed to the death but were not part of the sequence of events leading to death). MCCD issued by Shalby Hospital The Hindu had reported that 48-year-old COVID-19 positive Rupal Thakkar’s MCCD prepared by Ahmedabad’s Shalby Hospital mentioned “sudden cardiac arrest” as the cause of death. This was despite the fact that the form itself states that the mode of death such as heart attack should not be listed as the immediate cause of death. Alt News spoke with Thakkar’s family and gained access to her COVID-19 test (dated April 12) and MCCD. Her brother Dipan gave us permission to highlight the flaws in the MCCD. The MCCD was issued by Shalby Hospital’s consultant Dr Harshil Mehta. It is pertinent to note that the certificate doesn’t state that Thakkar was COVID positive despite the fact that she did test positive. Dipan also informed that as a result, the cremation took place without COVID-19 protocols. He also pointed out other errors such as age and time of admission to the hospital. A corrected MCCD was subsequently issued by Shalby Hospital to Thakkar’s family. This version mentions COVID-19 as the antecedent cause of death. However, it does not list the COVID-19 specific identify codes on MCCD as per the guidelines. Furthermore, Shalby Hospital didn’t amend the immediate cause of death either. Discussing the MCCD issued by Shalby Hospital, Chalapati Rao said, “The phrase ‘sudden cardiac arrest’ should not have been listed as an immediate cause of death. It’s against the guidelines. However, this practice is commonly followed due to a lack of checks and balances. If at all stated, cardiac arrest should be further qualified with the mention of a preceding clinical condition or disease that precipitated the cardiac arrest, which would then be considered as the underlying cause of death.” Alt News spoke with Dr Priyal, the on-duty doctor mentioned on Thakkar’s MCCD. She said that the MCCD was prepared as per Dr Mehta’s instructions. Dr Mehta in turn told Alt News, “Death certificate [MCCD] is just for our medical and corporation purpose. Whatever cause we are writing it is medically terminated and it for the data record. It is not certifying that the patient has died because of certain diseases.” However, Section 3, 10 (3) of The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 ( view pdf ) states “in the event of the death of any person who, during his last illness, was attended by a medical practitioner, the medical practitioner shall, after the death of that person, forthwith, issue without charging any fee, to the person required under this Act to give information concerning the death, a certificate in the prescribed form stating to the best of his knowledge and belief the cause of death ; and the certificate shall be received and delivered by such person to the Registrar at the time of giving information concerning the death as required by this Act.” To conclude, Gujarat CM Rupani’s interpretation that comorbidities such as cancer or diabetes can be listed as the primary cause of death for COVID-related fatalities is not as per ICMR’s written guidelines for appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India. Coronavirus cases are rapidly increasing in Gujarat. More than 14,000 cases are being reported in the State daily while the healthcare sector is overwhelmed with high demands it is unable to meet. Furthermore, fatalities due to COVID are much higher than the State government’s official death toll. On April 15, Sandesh News aired a 50-minute interview with Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. This video has been uploaded on YouTube in two segments. In the second segment at the 14-minute mark, the journalist asked, “There is one question that I must ask, please try to answer this question with an open heart so that the people of Gujarat gain some faith…Taking the example of Rajkot, the death toll is around 80.

If at all stated, cardiac arrest should be further qualified with the mention of a preceding clinical condition or disease that precipitated the cardiac arrest, which would then be considered as the underlying cause of death.” Alt News spoke with Dr Priyal, the on-duty doctor mentioned on Thakkar’s MCCD. She said that the MCCD was prepared as per Dr Mehta’s instructions. Dr Mehta in turn told Alt News, “Death certificate [MCCD] is just for our medical and corporation purpose. Whatever cause we are writing it is medically terminated and it for the data record. It is not certifying that the patient has died because of certain diseases.” However, Section 3, 10 (3) of The Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 (view pdf) states “in the event of the death of any person who, during his last illness, was attended by a medical practitioner, the medical practitioner shall, after the death of that person, forthwith, issue without charging any fee, to the person required under this Act to give information concerning the death, a certificate in the prescribed form stating to the best of his knowledge and belief the cause of death; and the certificate shall be received and delivered by such person to the Registrar at the time of giving information concerning the death as required by this Act.” To conclude, Gujarat CM Rupani’s interpretation that comorbidities such as cancer or diabetes can be listed as the primary cause of death for COVID-related fatalities is not as per ICMR’s written guidelines for appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India.

However, the most sought after drug during the current...",Remdesivir is effective against COVID-19,"Remdesivir is a patented antiviral drug by Gilead (US). It was initially developed to treat viral hepatitis, and a cold-like virus called respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but was later studied for antiviral activity against several viruses. Remdesivir wasn’t an effective treatment for either disease. However, some initial responses against other viruses made the FDA approve this drug to treat COVID-19 as a first. Currently, the Indian pharmaceutical giants Hetero labs and Dr Reddys sell the drug for just under Rs. 5000 per vial. Each vial is given per day for at least 5-10 days to hospitalised patients amounting to a significant economic burden on the patient. While not all hospitalised patients are getting the drug, it is administered extensively by the clinicians. In some cases, it is given upon the request of desperate patients. The belief that Remdesivier is the best available drug has turned people to hoard it, resulting in an acute shortage throughout the country. Guidelines for Remdesivir use in other countries Despite the US FDA approval, Remdesivir is not administered as extensively in other countries. For example, the NHS in the UK has clearly updated guidelines regarding its use such as eligibility criteria of only COVID-19 hospitalised patients those who clinically classify as suffering from pneumonia and require supplemental oxygen. It is also given in the early days during the onset of the symptoms, only to patients with age greater than 12 and over 40 kgs in weight, with an eGFR of at least 30 ml/min and ALT below 5 times the normal baseline of healthy people. eGFR & ALT are tests to assess kidney and liver function respectively. In India, the Ministry of Health also recommended it as an investigational therapy in their COVID-19 management protocol document and tweeted that “it is not a life-saving drug”. Despite that, it is widely used as the drug of choice for most hospitalised COVID-19 patients. As sources dwindle, COVID-19 patients have been struggling to procure it, but scientists have raised questions about the efficacy of Remdesivir. In July 2020, the ICMR and AIIMS suggested against the indiscriminate use of Remdesivir , but the ICMR has not released a written set of COVID-19 protocols under which the drug can be given only to those who clinically qualify for it. Scientific research is not analysed by the observance of effects in one or two people who have recovered after taking a drug. To deduce a high quality of scientific evidence, multiple studies on a large number of people are assessed together – called a systematic review. Here, we conduct a systematic review of four Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) conducted for Remdesivir (Veklury) and present the final higher quality evidence of its efficacy. Claim: Remdesivir is effective in treating all COVID-19 patients Verdict: False Fact-Check: Studies 1 & 2 showed Remdesivir cannot treat COVID-19. Study 1: Wang, Yeming, et al. “Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial.” The Lancet 395.10236 (2020): 1569-1578. This study, published in April 2020, was the first double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial (RCT). It was also a multicentre trial with ten hospitals in China with 237 patients. 158 of them were given Remdesivir, and the rest were given a placebo, while they were on other forms of COVID-19 protocol treatments. Despite a low sample size, the study found no significant differences in patients treated with Remdesivir in comparison with the placebo treatment. Study 2: Spinner, Christoph D., et al. “Effect of remdesivir vs standard care on clinical status at 11 days in patients with moderate COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial.” Jama 324.11 (2020): 1048-1057. Another study devised a slightly different testing methodology. Study 2 was published in September 2020 by scientists from 23 institutions globally ( GS-US-540-5774 Investigators ). The experiment was to study the effect of 5 and 10-day dosage in about 584 hospitalised patients of 46-66 years, both males and females, with a mix of comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While the five-day dose group showed better clinical improvement on day 11, the ten-day dose group showed no differences with standard care of treatment. However, the improvement in the five-day treatment group was only a tiny change. By day 28, a total of nine patients had died from all three groups, i.e. 5 and 10-day group and the placebo-controlled group receiving standard care. However, many reported side effects frequently observed in the Remdesivir groups, include nausea, hypokalemia, and headaches. Study 3 showed Remdesivir shortens COVID-19 recovery time. Study 3: Madsen, Lone Wulff. “Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19-Final Report.” The New England Journal of Medicine 338.19 (2020): 1813-1826. In November 2020, American scientists conducted another RCT (ACTT-1 Study Group Members) with opposing results regarding recovery times. In 1062 patients with 541 assigned to Remdesivir and 521 to placebo, those who received Remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (max 11) compared with 15 days (max 18) among those who received placebo. Thus, Remdesivir patients were more likely to get clinically better at day 15 than the placebo patients, indicating that the drug improved recovery periods. The mega Solidarity trial (study 4) by WHO that tested the effect of Remdesivir against COVID-19 Study 4: WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium. “Repurposed antiviral drugs for COVID-19—interim WHO SOLIDARITY trial results.” New England Journal of Medicine 384.6 (2021): 497-511. This was also called the Solidarity trial and was the most prominent trial for Remdesivir and other drugs administered during hospitalisation of a COVID-19 patient, funded by the WHO. This trial was published in February 2021 and was the most extensive study conducted so far of Remdesivir. It included data from a vast sample size yielding a high power in scientific validity with more than 11,000 patients. In the figure, Remdesivir performs no better than control for in-hospitalisation mortality, which means that the drug cannot prevent COVID-19 related deaths . Since it is an ongoing trial with the WHO , it has exceeded 12,000 participants, with a ‘Solidarity II’ underway for serological testing. The published trial included 30 countries, over 500 hospitals in all six regions of WHO with consistently matched comparable groups with objective outcomes. The primary consideration was that this trial was not funded by a pharmaceutical company or someone with a monetary interest in the drug industry. One of the limitations of this trial could be that the sub-groups only had 8% ventilated patients, which is a huge consideration to determine the severity of COVID-19. A second limitation was that there was no ongoing symptom data from patients across the 28-day period. Although the effect of the drug on mortality and the hospital duration was considered the outcome in the drug trial, the study demonstrated that Remdesivir neither changed mortality nor the duration of hospitalisation in such a massive sample of COVID-19 patients (see figure above from the Solidarity trial). Gilead Sciences, marketing and the lucrative market of Remdesivir Meanwhile, Gilead signed an over a billion-dollar deal of Remdesivir with the EU Commission before the extensive interim data of the WHO Solidarity trial (Study 4) was released and ruled out the lack of efficacy on COVID-19 mortality Remdesivir . Gilead quoted that the WHO trial was not rigorously reviewed, and the trial design might hold limitations to testing the drug. Gilead also quoted study 3, or the ‘ACTT-1 Study’ that favoured the role of Remdesivir in COVID-19 patients hailing it as the gold standard for testing efficacy and safety of the drugs. Meta-analysis- a part of systematic review for Remdesivir A meta-analysis assesses the data of many human trials (RCTs) in similar conditions of the same drug to determine the higher value of scientific evidence. Pooled data (see image) from the four significant trials, i.e study 1,2,3 and 4 above, across the world shows a modest amount of variability in the efficacy measured. (source: Dr Mike Johansen ). This analysis is based on a ‘random-effects model’, which assumes a distribution of treatment effects or the average treatment effect across the studies. The higher the i-squared, the greater the difference of effects between groups, but a higher weightage is given to the study with larger sample size, i.e. WHO Solidarity trial 2020, and while the higher i-squared score could be a result of study 3, i.e NEJIM, 2020. So why did one study (study 3) report different results? Clinicians have pondered on this since the ACTT-1 study was published earlier than the Solidarity trial. Some of them suggest that it could be due to a clinician bias while prescribing Remdesivir with a belief that this is the best drug in the market for COVID-19. The FDA clearance and a marked up media highlighting the popularity of the drug prior to the publication of its research could also be the reason why human cognitive biases could have added to the ‘placebo effect’ in a small number of patients. Such examples of biases were reported on Twitter by clinicians prescribing Remdesivir in the light of newly available Solidarity trial data. Effects on biochemical activity of coronavirus Study 5: Kokic, Goran, et al. “Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase stalling by remdesivir.” Nature communications 12.1 (2021): 1-7. In a petri dish or an ‘ex-vivo’ study, the drug has also shown some antiviral activity in several other viruses, as well as biochemical studies that suggest it has a strong RNA polymerase inhibition of coronavirus . RNA polymerases are crucial in the replication cycle, and inhibiting their activity can be a robust mechanistic that leads to further the research of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. As a result, many drug companies such as ‘ Creative Biolabs ’ are trying to create RNA polymerase inhibitor drugs against COVID-19. Many drugs show efficacy in ‘ex-vivo’ or outside a living body, whether animal or humans, but not many go through showing efficacy in animals and humans. However, at this point of the pandemic (April 2021), Remdesivir has shown no effects on mortality in human clinical trials related to COVID-19. Conclusion: Despite many extensive studies testing the effect of mortality and duration of hospitalisation, Remdesivir remains ineffective for most COVID-19 patients. It is still being used in patients for five days for those requiring oxygen, suggesting it can impact clinical improvement given very early during the disease to those requiring oxygen (see further guidelines as per the NHS, UK here ), but it may not prevent deaths. However, we are yet to see the effects of those in which Remdesivir is given exclusively in comparison with those who require supplemental oxygen and pneumonia patients. Since the large Solidarity trial itself suggests the lack of Remdesivir efficacy, the pooling of RCTs (meta-analysis above) strengthens the Solidarity data. It is possible that the pharmaceutical companies have promptly promoted drug efficacy during the global second wave and sought multimillion-dollar deals with different governments. However, in the light of this analysis, the desperation in acquiring Remdesivir specifically for economically underprivileged patients can prove difficult given that a 10-day course can be anywhere over Rs. 35,000 per patient. However, it can be used as a drug for a five-day period with those requiring oxygen and hospitalisation instead of prescribing it liberally as it is being done today. It may add to mild differences in clinical conditions if given at the right time. The approval by FDA has made it nearly impossible to set up a placebo vs Remdesivir trial as physicians would find it ethically challenging to randomise patients to placebo. Additionally, its adverse effects’ profile tilts the scales against its rampant, uncontrolled use in COVID-19 patients. It makes little scientific sense to suggest that it is a saviour drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection. On April 17, 2021, the Government of India decided to review the prices of Remdesivir (GS-5734™ or Veklury®) in the country. However, the most sought after drug during the current COVID-19 crisis is also being sold in the black market for desperate patients, while social media is inundated with requests for Remdesivir.

In a petri dish or an ‘ex-vivo’ study, the drug has also shown some antiviral activity in several other viruses, as well as biochemical studies that suggest it has a strong RNA polymerase inhibition of coronavirus. RNA polymerases are crucial in the replication cycle, and inhibiting their activity can be a robust mechanistic that leads to further the research of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. As a result, many drug companies such as ‘Creative Biolabs’ are trying to create RNA polymerase inhibitor drugs against COVID-19. Many drugs show efficacy in ‘ex-vivo’ or outside a living body, whether animal or humans, but not many go through showing efficacy in animals and humans. However, at this point of the pandemic (April 2021), Remdesivir has shown no effects on mortality in human clinical trials related to COVID-19. Conclusion: Despite many extensive studies testing the effect of mortality and duration of hospitalisation, Remdesivir remains ineffective for most COVID-19 patients. It is still being used in patients for five days for those requiring oxygen, suggesting it can impact clinical improvement given very early during the disease to those requiring oxygen (see further guidelines as per the NHS, UK here), but it may not prevent deaths. However, we are yet to see the effects of those in which Remdesivir is given exclusively in comparison with those who require supplemental oxygen and pneumonia patients. Since the large Solidarity trial itself suggests the lack of Remdesivir efficacy, the pooling of RCTs (meta-analysis above) strengthens the Solidarity data. It is possible that the pharmaceutical companies have promptly promoted drug efficacy during the global second wave and sought multimillion-dollar deals with different governments. However, in the light of this analysis, the desperation in acquiring Remdesivir specifically for economically underprivileged patients can prove difficult given that a 10-day course can be anywhere over Rs. 35,000 per patient. However, it can be used as a drug for a five-day period with those requiring oxygen and hospitalisation instead of prescribing it liberally as it is being done today. It may add to mild differences in clinical conditions if given at the right time. The approval by FDA has made it nearly impossible to set up a placebo vs Remdesivir trial as physicians would find it ethically challenging to randomise patients to placebo. Additionally, its adverse effects’ profile tilts the scales against its rampant, uncontrolled use in COVID-19 patients. It makes little scientific sense to suggest that it is a saviour drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, clinicians on the frontline would struggle to refuse the use of the drug, which has FDA regulatory approval status. Also, media sentiment has exploited the end-user desperation for a cure and has played a role in elevating the position of the drug in excess of what evidence would allow. A plausible reason for its continued use can be a lack of well researched, updated and unambiguous guidelines for the clinicians from any central body. Other reasons, such as economic gains or conspiracy theory, are beyond the scope of this analysis.",Dr. Sumaiya Shaikh,Mostly False,False,1

Camphor, Lavang and Ajwain can relieve respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. Verdict: False Fact check: 1. Camphor (Karpur) Camphor is a flammable white crystalline substance that has a strong aromatic odour. It is sometimes rubbed on the skin to reduce pain and itching. It is also used in topical nasal decongestant gels like Vicks VapoRub in small quantities (4-5%) but the evidence on its efficacy is mixed. Some older studies have found that camphor and eucalyptus have no effect on nasal decongestion. Nevertheless, blood oxygen saturation decreases in severe COVID-19 infections because of the lungs and lower respiratory tract damage and has little to do with nasal blockage. Similarly, another research suggests that reliving nasal obstruction doesn’t improve depressed oxygen saturation. Inhalation or ingestion of uncalibrated doses of non-medicinal camphor can lead to severe toxicity within a few minutes of exposure, especially in children . As per the American Association of Poison Control Center’s report, in the year 2018, there were around 9,500 cases of camphor poisoning in the USA, 10 of which were life-threatening and caused significant disability. FDA advises against doses of 11% or more C=camphor as it can cause toxicity and result in severe seizures. The US’s Center for Disease Control (CDC) has extensive toxicity data that shows that camphor exposure causes significant impairment in animals. As per CDC’s guidelines , inhalation of camphor vapours can lead to nose, throat and eye irritation. It can cause seizures, mental confusion, stomach ache and in higher concentration, it can also lead to death in some cases. There are several reported cases in India of poisoning caused by camphor vapour inhalation. 2. Clove (Lavang) This claim is based on a single literature review from Italy that hypothesizes the possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of cloves. However, the research cited within this review is based on the herpes simplex virus and is unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. The cited research is based on a compound eugenol which is found in cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and basil and is linked with toxicity. Although the pure extract of eugenol is not recommended in this viral text, clove vapour alone may be toxic but there is no research to suggest it can increase blood oxygen or relieve respiratory distress. 3. Carom seeds (Ajwain) and Eucalyptus oil For both substances above, there is no research or evidence to suggest that they increase blood oxygen or relieve respiratory distress. Conclusion: Other versions of the WhatsApp forward also attribute the message to ayurvedic practitioner Prajagraj Dabhi who supposedly treated COVID-19 patients with the formulation. Dabhi has rejected this claim. Yet other versions also claim that ambulances are using this formulation on COVID-19 patients. But no such treatment guidelines are mentioned in Health Ministry’s protocol for COVID-19 ambulances. A viral message widely shared across WhatsApp and Twitter suggests that inhaling the vapour of camphor, lawang, ajwain and eucalyptus oil can increase blood oxygen level and even relieve respiratory distress. Alt News Science found that there is no scientific basis to support this claim. Instead, sniffing the mixture can cause camphor poisoning, which in some cases is life-threatening.

Chyawanprash consumption can prevent COVID-19. Verdict: False Fact Check: In India, any clinical or human trials have to be registered with the ICMR’s Clinical Trials Registry – India (CTRI) before the trial begins, including AYUSH trials. Despite some shortcomings , CTRI entries help in ensuring better transparency, accountability and accessibility of trial-related data. We did a keyword search for ‘Chyawanprash’ and ‘Chyavanprash’ and found 10 clinical studies registered with CTRI. All these studies are trying to test if Chyawanprash consumption can prevent COVID-19. Out of these 10 studies, two were from Dabur India (last searched 3rd of April 2021). As per their CTRI entry, one of them had 696 participants and was conducted across 5 different centres. These details match with the study which was cited by Dabur in its advertisement and website. We did a keyword search for ‘Dabur Chyawanprash Clinical study on Covid-19’ on Google Scholar and PubMed database of scientific publications and found no results. Similarly, there were no preprints of the study on both BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers. This means that there is no research paper published by Dabur to back their claim. The results listed on their website are suspicious. The website claims that out of 351 participants who consumed Chyawanprash, 2.38% tested positive for COVID-19. 2.38% of 351 is 8.3538. The number of participants cannot be decimal, It has to be a whole number. Similarly in the control group, 28.57% of 345 tested positive for COVID-19. This comes out to be 98.5665 which is again a fraction and not a whole number. If we round up the decimal, 99 participants tested positive for COVID-19 in the control group as compared to just eight in the Chyawanprash group. This result is unbelievably high. One way to look at this result is that if a vaccine had these numbers , it would be 92% efficacious! Higher than both the Covaxin ( 81% ) and CovidShield ( 76% ) vaccines used in India right now. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. In Dabur’s case, there is no evidence at all. Dabur has not published any papers on either of the clinical trials they did on Chyawanprash. Hence the claim on their website and newspaper advertisement is misleading. News portals like NavBharat Times and News Track covered Dabur’s claims even when there was no peer-reviewed paper to support them. An inconclusive preprint study with Chyawanprash Of all the 10 clinical studies listed above, only one of them has been published. That too was published as a preprint and not as a peer-reviewed research paper. This study was funded by the Central Council of Research in Ayurveda Sciences (CCRAS), Ministry of AYUSH. They tried to test if Dabur Chyawanprash could prevent COVID-19 in a sample of just 193 participants. The conclusion as per their preprint is “Chyawanprash was well tolerated by all the participants in the intervention group but to prove its adaptogenic effect and efficacy as an add-on to the standard care in preventing the occurrence of COVID-19, clinical trial for longer duration with larger sample size is needed .” Further, the results of this preprint also suggested that those who consumed Chyawanprash had a significantly higher level of IgG -a long term inflammatory marker, usually due to longer lasting but subtle food sensitivities, than those without Chyawanprash. This result also means that the immune response due to Chyawanprash may be unfavourable for the body. Analysis of other Chyawanprash clinical studies paints a bleak picture. Consider this study funded by CCRAS where 49 participants were given Chyawanprash for 30 days and there was no control group. After the end of a month, two of the 49 participants ended up testing positive for COVID-19 yet the CTRI entry concludes, “The outcome of this pilot study is encouraging in context to a possible safe prophylactic remedy for COVID-19’’. This study has no scientific publication of the results either as a paper or a preprint yet. Similarly, other Chyawanprash trials are poorly designed too. While most of them have a control group, none of them is blinded. To ensure that the trial is not affected by bias, blinding is carried out where participants and clinicians are not informed whether they are getting the drug or the control. When blinding is not carried out, the researcher and the study participant may under-report their symptoms with a favourable view of Chyawanprash. There are some registered trials with larger sample sizes such as NIIMH-CCRAS, a Ministry of AYUSH funded study which has 5000 participants. This trial can give acceptable results if it is conducted properly. NIIMH-CCRAS is also funding a study of Chyawanprash as a COVID-19 preventive agent in 1500 police personnel in Telangana. But as per their CTRI data, both the trials should have ended by now but there is no public record of their results. As per their CTRI entries, several of the 10 trials should have completed their recruitment long back and yet there are no publications from most of those trials. One reason to explain this could be the file-drawer effect or publication bias . This happens when researchers register their trial, complete the trial but don’t publish their results because it is negative or inconclusive. Not publishing negative results is not just the breach of the trust of the study participants but also of citizens who funded many of these trials via the AYUSH ministry. CTRI registration was made mandatory to track such trials that don’t end up sharing their results. Conclusion: There is just a single published preprint, with substandard methods and inconclusive results that was found to use Chyawanprash to prevent COVID-19. That study was inconclusive and could not establish Chyawanprash’s efficacy. The other nine trials registered in CTRI are yet to be published. AYUSH ministry’s claim that Chyawanrprash can help in post-COVID-19 recovery is sans any evidence. Dabur has released no research paper to support their claim and the summary on their website is highly dubious. The COVID-19 pandemic has given a big boost to the Ayurvedic and other alternative therapeutics industry. Despite limited evidence, several ayurvedic products are being endorsed by many including the health minister and the Prime Minister of india.

That didn’t happen, but the mic did switch on after touchdown, recording the first-ever audio on the surface of another world .” In the backdrop of NASA’s Perseverance Rover landing on Mars on February 19 (IST), a video has gone viral on Twitter and Facebook with the claim it is an audio-video recording from Mars. The following video was posted by Twitter user Anonymous along with the text, “Mars, fascinating.” This video now has over 24 million views which four million views more than NASA’s live stream of the Perseverance Rover landing. Mars, fascinating. pic.twitter.com/WSyq8Ojna2 — Anonymous (@YourAnonOne) February 19, 2021 Alt News received multiple requests on WhatsApp to verify this video. The viral video was also shared by Odisha-based news outlet Kalinga TV, Srinivasan Ramani, deputy national editor at The Hindu, and Harini Calamur who leads Impact Science at Mumbai-based Cactus Communications. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Fact-check Alt News performed a reverse image search and found that the visuals in the viral video are identical to the panoramic image clicked by NASA’s Curiosity Rover last year. The size of the high-resolution image is over 2 GB. NASA also posted a 360 video based on this image. This video does not have sound. In the past, NASA has shared audio recordings from Mars. However, it was never along with a video. It appears that the viral video was made using these media files. We compared NASA’s 360 videos with the viral video and found that they were identical. Alt News couldn’t authenticate the source of the audio in the viral video. Further, we also noticed that the wheels on the rover in the viral video are identical to the ones present on the Curiosity Rover as per NASA.

Since the video was shared shortly after NASA’s recent Mars landing, it misleads millions of people to believe that it shows visuals and audio recorded by Perseverance Rover.",Archit,False,,1

In a statement on January 3, Bharat Biotech Chairman and Managing Director Dr Krishna Ella said that it is the company’s “goal” to provide the vaccine globally. Foreign envoys of 70 countries had visited manufacturing units of the company on December 9 but the visit did not follow any news of orders or pre-booking. In all likelihood, the number ‘190’ comes from the World Health Organisation (WHO) -led global initiative COVAX. On December 18, 2020, the WHO informed that “COVAX, the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level” announced that it had arrangements in place to access “nearly two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, on behalf of 190 participating economies “. The news was also reported in the media. All participating economies will have access to doses in the first half of 2021, said the WHO. Unlike Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India is a COVAX partner . The full list of deals secured by the WHO global alliance features SII’s vaccine Oxford-AstraZeneca (or Covishield in India). The WHO has acquired a deal for 200 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Novavax candidates via an agreement between Gavi, SII and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. SII is therefore producing the vaccine developed by Oxford and its pharmaceutical partner AstraZeneca. Covishield is not an Indian vaccine. Furthermore, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has invested in 10 vaccine candidates of which Oxford-AstraZeneca is a part and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is not. Since India-made Covaxin does not feature on both the lists, there cannot be any deals between COVAX with Bharat Biotech for the 190 participating countries. Moreover, while SII had issued a press release about COVAX, the word does not appear anywhere on the website of Bharat Biotech . It is noteworthy that Head of Serum Institute of India Adar Poonawalla stated that India will not allow the export of Covishield for several months. Editor-in-Chief and Chairman of India TV Rajat Sharma tweeted on January 3 that 190 countries have pre-booked COVID-19 vaccine developed by India. “The vaccine produced in our country is effective, cheap and easy to store. This is because of Narendra Modi’s policies and the skills of our scientists. Those who are suspicious about the vaccine should know that 190 countries have booked the vaccine in advance,” read his tweet, drawing over 30,000 likes as of this writing. अपने देश में बनी वैक्सीन कारगर है, सस्ती है और इसे स्टोर करना आसान है. ये नरेंद्र मोदी की नीति और हमारे वैज्ञानिकों की कुशलता का प्रतीक है. इस पर बेवजह शक करने वाले जान लें कि इस वैक्सीन की एडवाँस बुकिंग 190 देशों ने करवाई है. @narendramodi — Rajat Sharma (@RajatSharmaLive) January 3, 2021 In another tweet, Sharma wrote that he is referring to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. भारत में बनी कोवौक्सीन की जो लोग आलोचना कर रहे हैं, उन्हें मालूम होना चाहिए कि 190 देशों की सरकारों के कंसोर्शियम ने इस वैक्सीन की 2 अरब डोज़ की बुकिंग करवाई है. लोग गलतफहमियों के शिकार न हों, तथ्यों पर यकीन करें. #Covaxin — Rajat Sharma (@RajatSharmaLive) January 4, 2021 The DCGI recently approved the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) for restricted use in the country.

There is no doubt that India will play a major role in global COVID vaccine rollout as the country has vaccine production facilities and a large percentage of the world’s vaccines are already produced in India.

It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021 , which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch . However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed on a black stone is viral on social media. It is claimed that this stone was found in Afghanistan. Viral messages claim that though the stone is cool from the outside, it can melt anything made of steel and iron when placed in contact.

How is Pfizer’s vaccine administered? According to Pfizer’s product catalogue , the COVID-19 vaccine is called “Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (also known as BNT162b2)”. The product page also directs to two separate fact-sheets — 1) recipient and caregivers 2) healthcare providers administering vaccine . These documents were updated in December. As per the ‘healthcare providers administering’ vaccine fact-sheet, “The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is a suspension for intramuscular injection administered as a series of two doses (0.3mL each) 3 weeks apart.” Thus the suggestion that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is a 1 ml single-dose vaporizer cartridge is false. United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) also states, “The COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection into your upper arm. It’s given as 2 doses, at least 21 days apart.” Is Pfizer’s vaccine manufactured in China? Pfizer has four manufacturing centres in China but none of them has been used to manufacture the coronavirus vaccine. The company has listed specific locations from where the vaccines will be shipped. These are a part of its U.S. and European manufacturing networks. The vaccines will be shipped from the following locations: 1) Kalamazoo, US 2) Puurs, Belgian 3) Pleasant Prairie, US 4) Karlsruhe, Germany Since December 20, several social media users have been posting an image of a sealed pack of a Pfizer coronavirus vaccine that says “Made in China”.

The product page also directs to two separate fact-sheets — 1) recipient and caregivers 2) healthcare providers administering vaccine. These documents were updated in December. As per the ‘healthcare providers administering’ vaccine fact-sheet, “The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is a suspension for intramuscular injection administered as a series of two doses (0.3mL each) 3 weeks apart.” Thus the suggestion that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is a 1 ml single-dose vaporizer cartridge is false. United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) also states, “The COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection into your upper arm. It’s given as 2 doses, at least 21 days apart.” Is Pfizer’s vaccine manufactured in China? Pfizer has four manufacturing centres in China but none of them has been used to manufacture the coronavirus vaccine. The company has listed specific locations from where the vaccines will be shipped. These are a part of its U.S. and European manufacturing networks. The vaccines will be shipped from the following locations: 1) Kalamazoo, US 2) Puurs, Belgian 3) Pleasant Prairie, US 4) Karlsruhe, Germany Thus the image that allegedly shows a product with Pfizer’s brand was shared on the internet with the claim that COVID-19 vaccine has been manufactured in China. This image also misinforms about how the vaccine will be administered.",Archit,False,False,1

While these symptoms...",,"On October 6, 2020, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan released an “AYUSH standard treatment protocol” for the clinical management of COVID-19, that lists dietary measures, yoga, and Ayurvedic herbs with formulations. A long list of specific Ayurvedic recommendations for COVID-19 prevention and treatment were announced. This included the herb Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) for: For prevention of COVID-19 in a high-risk population such as healthcare workers, those living in COVID-19 hotspots, primary contacts of COVID-19 patients, etc. For prevention of COVID-19 complications in infected patients like fatigue, lung fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue) and for the changes in the mental well-being associated with the COVID-19 infection. ‘Ayush Standard Treatment Protocol’ ज़ारी करते हुए मैंने इसे एक ऐतिहासिक दिन बताया। मैं इसकी तुलना किसी साधारण Protocol से नहीं कर सकता। आयुर्वेद के लिए वैसे भी यह अच्छा दौर है। अभी संसद में भी इसे लेकर दो बिल पास किए गए, जो इसकी प्रासंगिकता को दर्शाता है। @PMOIndia @moayush pic.twitter.com/zdsS72gbaW — Dr Harsh Vardhan (@drharshvardhan) October 6, 2020 On October 6th, 2020, Dr Harsh Vardhan claimed that this AYUSH protocol is ‘not an ordinary protocol which makes its launch a historic day.’ He further claimed that the role of Ashwagandha and other herbs like Guduchi or Giloy is established for prophylaxis of COVID-19. In this article, we will review the claims made about the efficacy of Ashwagandha against COVID-19 in the AYUSH standard treatment protocol for COVID-19. Claims : According to Dr. Harsh Vardhan, the COVID-19 treatment protocol is based on research studies conducted by AYUSH. In healthy people, Ashwagandha can prevent COVID-19 infection. In COVID-19 patients, Ashwagandha can prevent disease complications like fatigue, lung scarring and the impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health. Verdict : False Fact-Check: By the time of the launch of the AYUSH protocol, various investigators had registered nine clinical trials for evaluating the efficacy of Ashwagandha against COVID-19 on the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI). This is an online public record system for registration of clinical trials being conducted in India. Such clinical trials are registered before enrolling participants to publicise the ethics approval on the methodology, provide information to potential participants and referring clinicians. The registration prevents selective reporting of desirable results and also prevents replication of the study by other researchers. 1. Clinical studies for Ashwagandha against COVID-19 A total of nine studies were registered with their respective ethics protocols on the CTRI. As per the timeline of these studies on CTRI: one out of the nine has been completed (but unpublished), three are are ‘open to recruitment’ for participants, and the remaining five have not even started. Thus, close to 50% of the studies have not started recruiting any patients for the study at the time when the AYUSH protocol was released (6th October 2020). Also, two-thirds of the studies will be conducted only in healthy people who do not have the infection. The remaining three are labelled as clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. Only one of the total three clinical trials registered is labelled as completed, the other two trials are either in the recruitment phase or have not started the study. Table 1 : Summary of the registered clinical trials on Ashwagandha against COVID-19 Thus, the AYUSH treatment protocol is not based on any published evidence for Ashwagandha . 2. Ashwagandha as a preventative drug in uninfected people While there are no published clinical trials showing any efficacy of Ashwagandha in preventing COVID-19 infection, we found six protocols included in the ethics application on the CTRI website. These studies were either ongoing, or in the process of starting, but not completed . Further, the experimental methods or protocols in these six studies listed some unethical and unscientific design flaws as described in table 2 below: Table 2: The status of six unpublished, ongoing studies on Ashwagandha in healthy people to prevent COVID-19. The table also lists their sub-standard methodology that may incorporate research bias in the final data (Data from CTRI, India as of 6th October 2020). 3. Ashwagandha as a treatment measure in COVID-19 patients Unlike section 2 of testing Ashwagandha in healthy people, three studies were registered as trials for COVID-19 patients. Out of which one was found to be completed, which was the only completed study featuring Ashwagandha against COVID-19. The second study was in the recruitment phase and the third had not yet started. However, the completed study has not been published or peer-reviewed and its data is not available in the public domain. Additionally, many severe methodological flaws were found in these three studies such that even if they are completed with positive outcomes related to COVID-19, their data cannot be trusted as it will include unprecedented bias (see table 3) as compared to most clinical trials conducted in COVID-19 patients. Table 3: The status of three unpublished, ongoing studies on Ashwagandha’s effect in COVID-19 patients. The table also lists their sub-standard methodology that may incorporate research bias in the final data. The study labelled ‘*’ suggests that it has completed data collection (Table 3, study 1). However, study 1 has not been reported as published or peer-reviewed. Data from CTRI, India as of 6th October 2020. The AYUSH researchers have designed studies in healthy people using conveniently small numbers of participants with no control groups, and excluded patients with low immunity, older people, and people with other comorbidities – who are at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms. They also evaluated the herb as an immunity booster, while keeping the study outcomes ambiguous so that they can account for natural improvement of mild cases, and unchanged asymptomatic cases as proof of efficacy of the herb. Not only the reduction in the increased severity of patients but also reduction in mortality in patients should be an important primary outcome of any treatment tested against COVID-19. N one of the 3 listed clinical trials on COVID-19 positive patients have set out to measure the important outcome of reduced death due to Ashwagandha treatment, even though some patients without the usual risk factors may die due to COVID-19. None of the studies of Ashwagandha measure the severity of the disease progression, in a controlled manner while being on the drug. Only 2/9 studies measure hospitalisation as one of the secondary outcomes. The one study listed as completed has not published any data, even as a preprint, to suggest any proof of efficacy that Dr Harsh Vardhan claimed as a basis of the AYUSH treatment protocol. Additionally, the protocol of these trials are based on several inclusion and exclusion criteria in such a way, that the research is only conducted in cases with low-moderate symptoms which have a good chance of recovering by itself. These trials conveniently exclude those patients that require hospitalisation after recruitment or mechanical ventilation. Thus, without including those who progressed to a severe version of the disease, it is unclear how the research will conclude the efficacy of Ashwagandha. It is without a doubt a sham way to conduct research that will always give results in the favour of the hypothesis regardless of any drug. Conclusion : To evaluate the efficacy of Ashwagandha , we reviewed the protocol applications on CTRI that are required to be approved by a panel from the ethical perspective of medical research. We found a total of 9 studies that were registered on Ashwagandha’s effect against COVID-19. Upon close analysis, only one study was completed on Ashwagandha , and the remaining 8 studies were either in the phase of recruitment of study participants or had not been started on the day the AYUSH protocol was released by Dr Harsh Vardhan. Without completion or published with peer review or analysing the quality of the evidence of multiple studies, the usage of herbal treatments in clinical patients is not only unethical, but also dangerous in a condition that has a high patient suffering leading to mortality . While the AYUSH ministry has been promoting alternative medicines to prevent COVID-19 since January 2020 without evidence, this promotion has taken a turn for the worse when the Minister of Health and Family Welfare (and not the AYUSH minister who had contracted COVID-19) launches alternative medicine protocols with no publically available evidence. It is essential to continue testing herbs for COVID-19 and other illnesses, but it is also imperative that they go through the same rigorous standards of scientifically designed clinical trials and peer review as any other modern medicine drug.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms such as pneumonia, clotting complications, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock are reported in many cases of the infection. While these symptoms may arise in severe cases (~19% of the total cases), symptoms like fever, headache, cough, malaise, muscle pain, sore throat, nasal congestion, etc. can occur in mild-to-moderate cases (Wu, Z. et al. 2020).

The table also lists their sub-standard methodology that may incorporate research bias in the final data. The study labelled ‘*’ suggests that it has completed data collection (Table 3, study 1). However, study 1 has not been reported as published or peer-reviewed. Data from CTRI, India as of 6th October 2020. Study Researcher Group Status Methodology from the ethics application 1 Jayanthi* Patients Completed, unpublished Included low-risk patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms. Included patients that received ongoing modern medical care. Lack of control group for comparison. Low sample size of 50 patients. Concoction drug of Ashwagandha– unclear which active ingredient will have efficacy in the patients. Drug tested as an immunity enhancer in a low-risk group but excluded patients with low immunity. 2 Singhal Patients Recruiting Testing many interventions with Ashwagandha at the same time like Kwath, Yoga, diet plan, etc. Includes patients that are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Both patients and researchers are aware of the treatments administered, e.g. lack of blinding. Includes a low-risk age of less than 60 years of age, with no comorbidities. The majority of complications and deaths are related to older patients with comorbidities. Enlists an unclear primary outcome, e.g. reduced mortality or reduced severity of disease. Unethical exclusion criteria of removing any patient from the study if their disease severity increases or develops side effects. 3 Singh Patients Not started Includes only mild-moderate cases. Excludes co-morbidities, low immunity patients, cases with respiratory complication and those require ventilators. Excludes any other condition in patients that jeopardises the outcome of the study. That is, only positive outcomes will be reported and the negative outcomes like mortality, progression of disease severity will be excluded. While the average duration of COVID-19 illness is 24.7 days (Verity R et al. 2020), patients will be only tested on day 7 & 15. This can lead to incomplete follow-up of the study and underreporting of the complications. The primary outcome: Clinical cure rate defined as time to negative conversion of the virus (clearance from the body). However, clinical features of COVID-19 can be independent of the presence of the infection. The AYUSH researchers have designed studies in healthy people using conveniently small numbers of participants with no control groups, and excluded patients with low immunity, older people, and people with other comorbidities – who are at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms. They also evaluated the herb as an immunity booster, while keeping the study outcomes ambiguous so that they can account for natural improvement of mild cases, and unchanged asymptomatic cases as proof of efficacy of the herb. Not only the reduction in the increased severity of patients but also reduction in mortality in patients should be an important primary outcome of any treatment tested against COVID-19. None of the 3 listed clinical trials on COVID-19 positive patients have set out to measure the important outcome of reduced death due to Ashwagandha treatment, even though some patients without the usual risk factors may die due to COVID-19. None of the studies of Ashwagandha measure the severity of the disease progression, in a controlled manner while being on the drug. Only 2/9 studies measure hospitalisation as one of the secondary outcomes. The one study listed as completed has not published any data, even as a preprint, to suggest any proof of efficacy that Dr Harsh Vardhan claimed as a basis of the AYUSH treatment protocol. Additionally, the protocol of these trials are based on several inclusion and exclusion criteria in such a way, that the research is only conducted in cases with low-moderate symptoms which have a good chance of recovering by itself. These trials conveniently exclude those patients that require hospitalisation after recruitment or mechanical ventilation. Thus, without including those who progressed to a severe version of the disease, it is unclear how the research will conclude the efficacy of Ashwagandha. It is without a doubt a sham way to conduct research that will always give results in the favour of the hypothesis regardless of any drug. Conclusion: To evaluate the efficacy of Ashwagandha, we reviewed the protocol applications on CTRI that are required to be approved by a panel from the ethical perspective of medical research. We found a total of 9 studies that were registered on Ashwagandha’s effect against COVID-19. Upon close analysis, only one study was completed on Ashwagandha, and the remaining 8 studies were either in the phase of recruitment of study participants or had not been started on the day the AYUSH protocol was released by Dr Harsh Vardhan. Without completion or published with peer review or analysing the quality of the evidence of multiple studies, the usage of herbal treatments in clinical patients is not only unethical, but also dangerous in a condition that has a high patient suffering leading to mortality. While the AYUSH ministry has been promoting alternative medicines to prevent COVID-19 since January 2020 without evidence, this promotion has taken a turn for the worse when the Minister of Health and Family Welfare (and not the AYUSH minister who had contracted COVID-19) launches alternative medicine protocols with no publically available evidence. It is essential to continue testing herbs for COVID-19 and other illnesses, but it is also imperative that they go through the same rigorous standards of scientifically designed clinical trials and peer review as any other modern medicine drug.

The same claim was earlier widespread via text messages on WhatsApp. “इटली विश्व का पहला देश बन गया है जिसनें एक कोविड-19 से मृत शरीर पर अटोप्सी (पोस्टमार्टम) किया और एक व्यापक जाँच करने के बाद पता लगाया है कि वायरस के रूप में कोविड-19 मौजूद नहीं है, बल्कि यह सब एक बहुत बड़ा ग्लोबल घोटाला है। लोग असल में “ऐमप्लीफाईड ग्लोबल 5G इलैक्ट्रोमैगनेटिक रेडिएशन (ज़हर)” के कारण मर रहे हैं,” reads a part of the message.

US n mny cointrirs wth strongest Intel agencies cudnt detect d fact? WHO. cheated d world?Is Corona not a Virus but a bacterial infection and patients can cure only in one day? See this video and share it so that d facts can b verified. pic.twitter.com/drXuR8uyd3 — Chowkidar Ravichiruvolu🇮🇳 proudBhaaratheeyan🇮🇳 (@Ravichiruvolu1) June 12, 2020 This video and similar Facebook post claim that Italy is the first country to defy World Health Organisation (WHO) “law” to not carry out autopsies on patients who died of COVID-19. It also blames the 5G technology for COVID-19 deaths. Claims COVID-19 is a bacterium, not a virus. There is a ‘World Health Law’ prohibiting autopsies on the patients who died of COVID-19 The WHO ordered immediate incineration or burial of the deceased COVID-19 patients The WHO labelled the bodies of COVID-19 patients as highly polluted Italy became the first country to conduct an autopsy on COVID-19 patients The Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed COVID-19 treatment protocols in response to autopsies The ventilators and the ICU were never needed for COVID-19 patients Italy defeated COVID-19 5G amplified COVID-19 Verdict: False. Fact-check 1. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, not a bacterium. Evidence from tissue samples of patients, epidemiological data, clinical data, genomic data conclusively establishes that the current pandemic named COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus and not by a bacterium. Alt News Science has previously published a detailed fact-check on this claim. 2. The WHO does not advise against autopsy of deceased COVID-19 patients. There is no such thing as “world health law” that the WHO has control over. The WHO is not an executive body to give out ‘orders’ to countries all over the world. As early as March 24, 2020, WHO had released an interim guidance on “Infection Prevention and Control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of COVID-19.” In this guidance, WHO does not advise against autopsy of deceased persons infected with COVID-19. In fact, it lays down the safety precautions for performing these autopsies when required. The updated WHO interim guideline dated September 4, 2020 is also consistent with the initial guidance. Therefore it is not true that WHO ever advised against the autopsy of deceased COVID-19 patients. 3. The WHO did not order immediate incineration or burial of deceased COVID-19 patients The WHO’s initial interim guidance states, “Hasty disposal of a dead from COVID-19 should be avoided. Authorities should manage each situation on a case-by-case basis, balancing the rights of the family, the need to investigate the cause of death, and the risks of exposure to infection.” The latest WHO guideline also confirms this “all measures should respect the dignity of the dead including avoiding hasty disposal of the body of a person who has died of COVID-19.” Thus, rather than ‘ordering’ immediate disposal of the body of deceased COVID-19 patients, the WHO has advised against it from the very beginning. 4. The WHO did not label the bodies of COVID-19 patients as highly polluted The WHO’s initial interim guideline notes “except in cases of hemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola, Marburg) and cholera, dead bodies are generally not infectious. Only the lungs of patients with pandemic influenza, if handled improperly during an autopsy, can be infectious. Otherwise, cadavers do not transmit disease. There is no evidence of persons having become infected from exposure to deceased COVID-19 patients.” The latest WHO guideline adds “based on current knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19 and its main modes of transmission (droplet/contact), the likelihood of transmission when handling human remains is low.” Thus, rather than calling them ‘highly polluted,’ the WHO has suggested low likelihood of transmission when handling human remains of deceased COVID-19 patients. 5. Italy is not the first country to conduct an autopsy on COVID-19 patient One of the first autopsy reports on patients who died of COVID-19 came from China on February 16, 2020. The first cluster of COVID-19 in Italy (local transmission) which had one death was not noted until February 21, 2020 . 6. The Italian government did not change the protocol in response to autopsies The interim guideline released by the Italian government on March 22, 2020, laid down recommendations for an autopsy of patients who died of COVID-19 infection. This guidance even predated the initial WHO guidance by two days. The websites of the Health Ministry of Italy show that there is no change in their protocol for COVID-19, and it has been considered as a disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Their FAQ doesn’t even mention clots or thrombi. Anticoagulants like heparin are used globally, including in Italy for the prevention and treatment of clotting abnormalities in severe COVID-19 patients ( Miesbach, W et al 2020 ). This does not mean that they do not think it is a viral illness or that COVID-19 only causes thrombosis. Alt News Science has previously debunked the claims that COVID-19 is caused by bacteria . Since the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 were publicly known since February 2020 ( Tang N et al. 2020 ), and even autopsy reports note the same (Fox, S. E. et al. 2020) , there is no truth to the claim that this was a well-kept secret by the WHO suddenly uncovered by Italian doctors from one protocol defying autopsy. 7. Severe coronavirus infections require ventilatory and ICU support About 5–15% of patients with COVID-19 infection require intensive care surveillance and ventilatory support ( Möhlenkamp, S et al. 2020 ). Alt News Science has previously published a detailed fact-check on this claim. 8. Italy has not defeated COVID-19. Note that the various version of claims covered in this article date back to at least 10 May 2020 . Yet, as of 17 September 2020, Italy still has 41,413 active cases . Therefore, Italy is far from defeating COVID-19. 9. 5G technology has not amplified COVID-19 There is no correlation between the use of 5G and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in any country. For instance, India did not roll out 5G, but ranks 2nd in the world in terms of total COVID-19 case burden and is currently recording the highest number of daily cases. Similarly, Iran did not roll out 5G but has recorded over 395,000 cases of COVID-19. On the other hand, South Korea, a leader in 5G deployment with nationwide coverage, has been successful in flattening the COVID-19 curve with aggressive testing and other measures. Similarly, New Zealand had deployed 5G but totalled only 1792 COVID-19 cases and was free of the first wave of COVID-19. A fresh outbreak in the country was reported in August. In fact, rather than higher frequency electromagnetic waves “amplifying” a virus, the opposite happens – viruses are inactivated by the strong electromagnetic waves. The ultraviolet rays can kill various airborne bacteria and viruses ( Szeto, W. et al. 2020 ). For this reason, the ultraviolet and gamma rays are commonly used disinfectants. A detailed article addressing the health concerns related to 5G can be read here . Conclusion The various conspiracy claims about the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO ‘law’ and ‘orders’ and Italian Health ministry are false. It is absurd to assert that the nature of the pathogen causing the pandemic and its cure can be kept hidden from the world. The knowledge and communication gap between experts and the masses, lack of trust in authorities, contribute to the conspiracy theories that quickly spread. But these conspiracy theories only make the situation worse as they give rise to the misinfodemic. Conspiracy theories that COVID-19 is not an infection encourage complacency and non-adherence to social distancing, rigorous hand-washing and use of masks. They can also encourage people to dangerously self-medicate with anticoagulants and antibiotics, hoping to cure the illness in the light of a shortage of hospital beds and high costs of in-patient treatment.

Typical animal or plant cells are between 10µm to 100µm in size, bacteria are much smaller around 1µm in size, viruses are even smaller between 5nm to 300nm (see picture below). The novel coronavirus is approximately 100nm in size ( Bar-On, Y et al. 2020 ). These structural differences between animal (including human) or plant cells and bacteria can be observed in a basic laboratory of infectious pathogens, while we need specialised equipment to visualise viruses. If the infectious germ of COVID-19 was a bacteria, it would not have remained a matter of controversy for this long. In patients presenting with an outbreak of viral pneumonia in January 2020, the responsible pathogen (disease-causing microorganism) was initially unknown. The fluid sampled from the lungs (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) of the patients who had been exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan were obtained. They had tested negative for commonly known respiratory tract pathogens. These samples were cultured, and genome sequencing was done. Genome sequencing is a process of finding out the order of DNA nucleotides, or bases, in all the genes—the order of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts that make up an organism’s genome. The genome sequences of those samples were remarkably similar (not the same) to a previously identified virus which had caused two outbreaks in the past. This new organism was thus identified as a new coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The same virus (SARS-CoV-2) has since been found during the contact tracing for the infected individuals via RT-PCR test – the COVID-19 test conducted in the hospitals on suspected people. Later, CDC, USA also released a schematic diagram of the virus structure (see below) to suggest the mechanism by which the virus enters the human cells. A protein on the surface of the virus (s protein) was found to be attached to a specific receptor (ACE2) on the surface of the human cell to gain entry and multiply inside the human cells ( Xu, X et al 2020 ). Therefore, evidence from tissue samples of patients, epidemiological data, clinical data, genomic data all conclusively establish that the current pandemic named COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus and not by a bacterium. About 5–15% of patients with COVID-19 infection require intensive care surveillance and ventilatory support ( Möhlenkamp, S et al. 2020 ). This is primarily because of the effects of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome on the ability of the patient to maintain respiration on their own. Other manifestations of COVID-19 like Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), acute pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction etc., usually require ICU support ( Klok, F.A et al. 2020 ). Many of the difficulties of thromboembolism (dislodgement of multiple small clots from a more massive lump) or DIC require mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it is not true that COVID-19 patients never require ventilator and ICU support. The mean time between the onset of the disease to the recovery of COVID-19 patients is 24.7 days ( Verity R et al. 2020 ), see figure below. Therefore, it is not true that COVID-19 can be cured in a day. Conclusion There is an ample amount of evidence that the current pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It is absurd to assert that the nature of the microbe causing the epidemic and its cure, can all be kept hidden from the world. While COVID-19 deniers have various motives to spread conspiracy theories, it is the knowledge and communication gap between experts and the masses, and lack of trust in authorities that allow these theories to thrive despite easily available evidence to the contrary. While a viral video claiming that COVID-19 never requires ventilatory and ICU support and can be cured in a day would sound reassuring to people, this is not true. Severe COVID-19 cases can only be managed with intensive care like organ support interventions. These conspiracy theories only make the situation worse as they encourage complacency and non-adherence to social distancing, rigorous hand-washing and use of masks.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, not a bacterium. There are huge structural differences between virus, bacteria and human cells as visual observation of bacteria and human cells is possible with a simple microscope, but not of a virus. Typical animal or plant cells are between 10µm to 100µm in size, bacteria are much smaller around 1µm in size, viruses are even smaller between 5nm to 300nm (see picture below). The novel coronavirus is approximately 100nm in size (Bar-On, Y et al. 2020). These structural differences between animal (including human) or plant cells and bacteria can be observed in a basic laboratory of infectious pathogens, while we need specialised equipment to visualise viruses. If the infectious germ of COVID-19 was a bacteria, it would not have remained a matter of controversy for this long. In patients presenting with an outbreak of viral pneumonia in January 2020, the responsible pathogen (disease-causing microorganism) was initially unknown. The fluid sampled from the lungs (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) of the patients who had been exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan were obtained. They had tested negative for commonly known respiratory tract pathogens. These samples were cultured, and genome sequencing was done. Genome sequencing is a process of finding out the order of DNA nucleotides, or bases, in all the genes—the order of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts that make up an organism’s genome. The genome sequences of those samples were remarkably similar (not the same) to a previously identified virus which had caused two outbreaks in the past. This new organism was thus identified as a new coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, evidence from tissue samples of patients, epidemiological data, clinical data, genomic data all conclusively establish that the current pandemic named COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus and not by a bacterium. 2. Severe coronavirus infections require ventilatory and ICU support About 5–15% of patients with COVID-19 infection require intensive care surveillance and ventilatory support (Möhlenkamp, S et al. 2020). This is primarily because of the effects of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome on the ability of the patient to maintain respiration on their own. Other manifestations of COVID-19 like Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), acute pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction etc., usually require ICU support (Klok, F.A et al. 2020). Many of the difficulties of thromboembolism (dislodgement of multiple small clots from a more massive lump) or DIC require mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it is not true that COVID-19 patients never require ventilator and ICU support. 3. COVID-19 cannot be cured in a day The mean time between the onset of the disease to the recovery of COVID-19 patients is 24.7 days (Verity R et al. 2020), see figure below. Therefore, it is not true that COVID-19 can be cured in a day. Onset-to-recovery data from 169 cases of COVID-19 outside of mainland China (Verity R et al. 2020) Conclusion There is an ample amount of evidence that the current pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It is absurd to assert that the nature of the microbe causing the epidemic and its cure, can all be kept hidden from the world. While COVID-19 deniers have various motives to spread conspiracy theories, it is the knowledge and communication gap between experts and the masses, and lack of trust in authorities that allow these theories to thrive despite easily available evidence to the contrary.

Claims : Immunity boosting is used to treat or prevent COVID-19 infection Natural plants or herbs can boost the immune system to prevent infections AYUSH Kwath (kadha) herbal formulation boosts immunity against COVID-19 The herbs of AYUSH Kwath boost immunity against COVID-19 AYUSH Kwath has no side effects of prolonged use Verdict: False Fact-check: Our immune system has two broad components, innate and adaptive immunity, which were explained in our previous Alt News Science article . What does it mean to ‘boost’ our immune system against infections? ‘Immunity booster’ is not a medical term. It is often used in common parlance for foods that have antioxidant properties. But these are a part of a balanced diet which maintain our immune system and general health and do not enhance it beyond what our body innately has to justify the term ‘immunity booster.’ A healthy immune system can only be achieved with adequate sleep, a balanced diet, exercise and adequate sunlight or vitamin D, unless the patient is suffering from an immune system disease such as AIDS, bone marrow cancer or is undergoing other immune-modulatory treatments like chemotherapy or steroids Allergies and autoimmune diseases are caused by a hyperactive immune system The blanket call for ‘boosting’ the immune system stems from a myopic view of the immune system as a defence system that always protects us from infections. But an otherwise well functioning immune system capable of fighting off infections can also cause a variety of disorders grouped under the term ‘hypersensitivity’. In hypersensitivity disorders, our immune system is over-activated which harms our own body. Examples of these disorders are allergic reactions which are immediate hypersensitivity reactions against substances that are not supposed to cause reactions in healthy patients like nuts, pollens, dust particles and a variety of autoimmune disorders like psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc. Suppression of the immune system, not ‘boosting’ is required for certain severe COVID-19 cases In some patients with severe COVID-19 infection, there is a ‘cytokine storm’ which has been the cause of death in many young and healthy people with no comorbidities like high blood pressure and diabetes. Cytokines are protein signalling molecules that mediate and regulate immunity and inflammation. But in various infectious and non-infectious diseases, there is a ‘storm’ of excessive cytokines released in the blood circulation. In COVID-19, this cytokine storm is followed by the immune system attacking the body, which causes ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and multiple organ failure. In such severe cases, the treatment is geared towards suppressing this overactive immune system to save the patient. Thus, the use of steroids like Dexamethasone to suppress the immune system is recommended at the right time to save the patient from death due to COVID-19. Most COVID-19 patients recover on their own and no amount of immunity-boosting can prevent the death of those who succumb While most of the COVID-19 patients recover on their own and would not benefit from formulations claiming to be ‘immunity boosters,’ many severe cases of COVID-19 need suppression (instead of a boost) of the immune system through established drugs like dexamethasone. While there is no clinical proof of efficacy of Kadha/AYUSH Kwath, it is not desirable to boost the immune system of severe COVID-19 patients, many of whom die of an overactive immune system. Only the adaptive immune system can be specific towards a pathogen. Therefore, the immune system can be theoretically enhanced against COVID-19 only from an active method like a vaccine against COVID-19 or a passive method like plasma with antibodies of seropositive patients, i.e. blood component of previously infected and recovered from COVID-19 who have demonstrated COVID-19 antibodies in their blood. Thus natural foods/herbs, or even synthetic antiviral drugs, do not equip our immune system with the ability to prevent COVID-19 disease. A preprint computer simulation study (i.e, a study that is not tested in humans or animals and the results are not peer-reviewed by other scientists) by Khanal, P. et al. (2020) aims to validate the kadha recommended by the Ministry of AYUSH as an ‘immunity booster’ against severe COVID-19 infection. They identified phytoconstituents from six herbs, including the four herbs that are used in AYUSH Kwath that regulate different pathways of the immune system. It is a study conducted through computer simulation and not one done on any living organism or cells. Thus, this study does not give proof of efficacy for AYUSH Kwath or kadha against COVID-19. There are no research studies on the AYUSH Kwath formulation. Therefore, there is no empirical proof, i.e. based on a scientifically validated observation, and not mere theory, of its efficacy against COVID-19. Let us look at any available evidence from previous clinical trials related to these herbs for their efficacy in immunomodulation (boosting or suppression) against viral infections. Immunomodulation refers to any process in which an immune response is altered to the desired level, and this may involve suppression of an overactive immune response or vice versa. Holy basil A double-blinded randomized controlled trial by Mondal S et al. (2011) on 22 healthy volunteers found that there was a statistically significant increase in the levels of various IFN-, IL-4 (which are cytokines) and T-helper cells and NK-cells (which are types of white blood cells) after four weeks in the group that received Tulsi extract in contrast to the placebo group. Given the easier availability of healthy volunteers, a sample size of 22 is too small and further studies would be needed to see if the findings are replicable. And as we have seen, it would actually be harmful if the Tulsi extracts could increase the cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients. There have been two clinical studies of holy basil against viral infections and both have very poor methodological quality. The first study by Rajalakshmi et al. (1986) studied the effect of Tulsi on 20 viral hepatitis patients. It shows clinical improvement after taking Tulsi but this sample size is very small and there was no control group to compare with. The second study by Das et al. (1983) has a similar drawback of a very small sample size of 14 cases of viral encephalitis. We have explained the impact of small sample size and lack of control groups in clinical studies in our previous Alt News Science article . Cinnamon We have noted in a previous article at Alt News Science that despite some studies suggesting antibacterial activity of cinnamon against bacteria like Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus plantarum and inhibition of fungal infections such as candidiasis, the evidence needed more validation since it is based on flakey preliminary data (Ulbricht, C. et al. 2011) . However, there are no clinical studies of cinnamon extracts that show the immunomodulatory effect on healthy individuals or any effects in viral infections. Black pepper There are no clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy of black pepper against any infection or any immunomodulatory effect. Also, WHO has debunked the claim of using pepper to prevent COVID-19 infection. (see infographic) Dry ginger There are no clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of dry ginger in viral infections. A pilot study by Stefano, D. et al. (2019) on 10 healthy individuals showed immunomodulatory effects of the combination of Echinacea angustifolia and Zingiber officinale in softgel capsules. They measured the expression of genes in white blood cells (cells responsible for immune function in the blood) of the volunteers and found that after they consumed these softgel capsules, 500 genes were differentially expressed (the process through which the genes makes proteins) in these leukocytes. All these together shifted the leukocyte activity towards suppression of inflammation (which is a response of the immune system). So, contrary to the claims of boosting, the immunomodulation in this study can be similar to the one directed by hydrocortisone administration, a steroid drug used to suppress the immune system. Thus, there is no observational validity to deduce that any of these drug components even given as an independent dose will help the COVID-19 patients in any form. Moreover, the dosage of these herbs or the active ingredient concentration that achieves this modulation of immune proteins has not been studied thoroughly. Since there is no clinical study done for AYUSH Kwath formulation, the interactions possible among its various active ingredients are unknown. Let us look at a few examples of side effects associated with the individual herbs. Cinnamon Cinnamon supplements can cause acute hepatitis; cinnamon oil and cinnamon flavoured gum can cause allergic contact dermatitis and other allergic reactions ( Hajimonfarednejad, M. et al. 2019 ). Dry ginger Preparations made from dry ginger can cause liver damage in certain patients ( Suzuki, Y. et al. 2015 ) and therapeutic use of ginger for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy was associated with a shorter gestational age (duration of pregnancy) and in a smaller circumference of the newborn’s skull ( Trabace, L. et al. 2015 ). Black pepper Piperine, the main constituent of black pepper, increases the blood levels of various rifampicin, sulphadiazine, tetracycline and phenytoin which may harm certain patients by increasing the side effects of these medications ( Velpandian, T. et al. 2001 ). It also increases the gastric acid secretion, potassium loss, gastric cell exfoliation (erosion) ( Srinivasan, K. 2007 ). Holy basil Animal studies show that holy basil can increase the bleeding time (the time taken for the blood to clot) ( Singh, S. et al. 2001 ) and decrease blood sugar ( Gholap, S. .et al. 2004 ). Therefore, these herbs can cause side effects and interact with synthetic/modern medicines, especially since the ministry recommends them for long-term use with no need for consultation with a doctor. Conclusion While a healthy diet and lifestyle help in maintaining the immunity that we innately possess, there is no way to pop a pill or drink kadha and ‘boost’ the immune system. The term ‘immunity booster’ has no basis in medical science, and yet it remains widely used by the Ministry of AYUSH and the media alike. The market is flooded with ‘immunity boosters’ with everything from khakhra and bread to shirts and beddings claiming to boost our immunity against COVID-19. They divert attention from the harder but proven preventive measures such as social distancing and consistently using masks and washing hands. AYUSH ministry has encouraged mass production of formulations like AYUSH Kwath without testing it for efficacy or safety in humans. It seems to be unaware of the potential dangers of ‘boosting’ the immune system in diseases like COVID-19, where an overactive immune system kills patients. The long-term use of AYUAH Kwath could cause various side-effects in healthy individuals as well. Thus, there is a lack of clarity in immune-boosting or suppression achievable through the intake of these herbs. The research on individual drugs has not shown any proof that it will affect COVID-19 patients or protect healthy people from getting infected. Moreover, since ‘immune-boosting’ should not be achieved theoretically in patients of COVID-19, the claims of immune-boosting via AYUSH Kwath or kadha may harm infected patients. Since, there is no proof that the concoction will help the patients, kwath or kadha may serve as a ‘feel-good’ warm drink during a sore throat, which is better categorised as a placebo relief.

While there is no clinical proof of efficacy of Kadha/AYUSH Kwath, it is not desirable to boost the immune system of severe COVID-19 patients, many of whom die of an overactive immune system. 2. Can herbs boost our immune system specifically against COVID-19? Only the adaptive immune system can be specific towards a pathogen. Therefore, the immune system can be theoretically enhanced against COVID-19 only from an active method like a vaccine against COVID-19 or a passive method like plasma with antibodies of seropositive patients, i.e. blood component of previously infected and recovered from COVID-19 who have demonstrated COVID-19 antibodies in their blood. Thus natural foods/herbs, or even synthetic antiviral drugs, do not equip our immune system with the ability to prevent COVID-19 disease. 3. AYUSH Kwath (kadha) cannot boost immunity against COVID-19 A preprint computer simulation study (i.e, a study that is not tested in humans or animals and the results are not peer-reviewed by other scientists) by Khanal, P. et al. (2020) aims to validate the kadha recommended by the Ministry of AYUSH as an ‘immunity booster’ against severe COVID-19 infection. They identified phytoconstituents from six herbs, including the four herbs that are used in AYUSH Kwath that regulate different pathways of the immune system. It is a study conducted through computer simulation and not one done on any living organism or cells. Thus, this study does not give proof of efficacy for AYUSH Kwath or kadha against COVID-19. There are no research studies on the AYUSH Kwath formulation. Therefore, there is no empirical proof, i.e. based on a scientifically validated observation, and not mere theory, of its efficacy against COVID-19. 4. The individual herbs Ayush Kwath or any other herbs do not boost immunity against COVID-19 Let us look at any available evidence from previous clinical trials related to these herbs for their efficacy in immunomodulation (boosting or suppression) against viral infections. Immunomodulation refers to any process in which an immune response is altered to the desired level, and this may involve suppression of an overactive immune response or vice versa. Holy basil A double-blinded randomized controlled trial by Mondal S et al. (2011) on 22 healthy volunteers found that there was a statistically significant increase in the levels of various IFN-, IL-4 (which are cytokines) and T-helper cells and NK-cells (which are types of white blood cells) after four weeks in the group that received Tulsi extract in contrast to the placebo group. Given the easier availability of healthy volunteers, a sample size of 22 is too small and further studies would be needed to see if the findings are replicable. And as we have seen, it would actually be harmful if the Tulsi extracts could increase the cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients. There have been two clinical studies of holy basil against viral infections and both have very poor methodological quality. The first study by Rajalakshmi et al. (1986) studied the effect of Tulsi on 20 viral hepatitis patients. It shows clinical improvement after taking Tulsi but this sample size is very small and there was no control group to compare with. The second study by Das et al. (1983) has a similar drawback of a very small sample size of 14 cases of viral encephalitis. We have explained the impact of small sample size and lack of control groups in clinical studies in our previous Alt News Science article. Cinnamon We have noted in a previous article at Alt News Science that despite some studies suggesting antibacterial activity of cinnamon against bacteria like Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus plantarum and inhibition of fungal infections such as candidiasis, the evidence needed more validation since it is based on flakey preliminary data (Ulbricht, C. et al. 2011). However, there are no clinical studies of cinnamon extracts that show the immunomodulatory effect on healthy individuals or any effects in viral infections. Black pepper There are no clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy of black pepper against any infection or any immunomodulatory effect. Also, WHO has debunked the claim of using pepper to prevent COVID-19 infection. (see infographic) Dry ginger There are no clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of dry ginger in viral infections. A pilot study by Stefano, D. et al. (2019) on 10 healthy individuals showed immunomodulatory effects of the combination of Echinacea angustifolia and Zingiber officinale in softgel capsules. They measured the expression of genes in white blood cells (cells responsible for immune function in the blood) of the volunteers and found that after they consumed these softgel capsules, 500 genes were differentially expressed (the process through which the genes makes proteins) in these leukocytes. All these together shifted the leukocyte activity towards suppression of inflammation (which is a response of the immune system). So, contrary to the claims of boosting, the immunomodulation in this study can be similar to the one directed by hydrocortisone administration, a steroid drug used to suppress the immune system. Thus, there is no observational validity to deduce that any of these drug components even given as an independent dose will help the COVID-19 patients in any form. Moreover, the dosage of these herbs or the active ingredient concentration that achieves this modulation of immune proteins has not been studied thoroughly. 5. The herbs of AYUSH Kwath can have side effects Since there is no clinical study done for AYUSH Kwath formulation, the interactions possible among its various active ingredients are unknown. Let us look at a few examples of side effects associated with the individual herbs. Cinnamon Cinnamon supplements can cause acute hepatitis; cinnamon oil and cinnamon flavoured gum can cause allergic contact dermatitis and other allergic reactions (Hajimonfarednejad, M. et al. 2019). Dry ginger Preparations made from dry ginger can cause liver damage in certain patients (Suzuki, Y. et al. 2015) and therapeutic use of ginger for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy was associated with a shorter gestational age (duration of pregnancy) and in a smaller circumference of the newborn’s skull (Trabace, L. et al. 2015). Black pepper Piperine, the main constituent of black pepper, increases the blood levels of various rifampicin, sulphadiazine, tetracycline and phenytoin which may harm certain patients by increasing the side effects of these medications (Velpandian, T. et al. 2001). It also increases the gastric acid secretion, potassium loss, gastric cell exfoliation (erosion) (Srinivasan, K. 2007). Holy basil Animal studies show that holy basil can increase the bleeding time (the time taken for the blood to clot) (Singh, S. et al. 2001) and decrease blood sugar (Gholap, S. .et al. 2004). Therefore, these herbs can cause side effects and interact with synthetic/modern medicines, especially since the ministry recommends them for long-term use with no need for consultation with a doctor. Conclusion While a healthy diet and lifestyle help in maintaining the immunity that we innately possess, there is no way to pop a pill or drink kadha and ‘boost’ the immune system. The term ‘immunity booster’ has no basis in medical science, and yet it remains widely used by the Ministry of AYUSH and the media alike. The market is flooded with ‘immunity boosters’ with everything from khakhra and bread to shirts and beddings claiming to boost our immunity against COVID-19. They divert attention from the harder but proven preventive measures such as social distancing and consistently using masks and washing hands. AYUSH ministry has encouraged mass production of formulations like AYUSH Kwath without testing it for efficacy or safety in humans. It seems to be unaware of the potential dangers of ‘boosting’ the immune system in diseases like COVID-19, where an overactive immune system kills patients. The long-term use of AYUAH Kwath could cause various side-effects in healthy individuals as well. Thus, there is a lack of clarity in immune-boosting or suppression achievable through the intake of these herbs. The research on individual drugs has not shown any proof that it will affect COVID-19 patients or protect healthy people from getting infected. Moreover, since ‘immune-boosting’ should not be achieved theoretically in patients of COVID-19, the claims of immune-boosting via AYUSH Kwath or kadha may harm infected patients. Since, there is no proof that the concoction will help the patients, kwath or kadha may serve as a ‘feel-good’ warm drink during a sore throat, which is better categorised as a placebo relief.

It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021 , which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch . However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed on a black stone is viral on social media. It is claimed that this stone was found in Afghanistan. Viral messages claim that though the stone is cool from the outside, it can melt anything made of steel and iron when placed in contact. Twitter user @kabirkhan488 shared the clip with the same claim.

So did several other journalists including editor at Ohio-based Richland Source Larry Phillips , author at Swarajya and The Times of India Aashish Chandorkar and f ilm correspondent at Sify and author at Firstpost Rajashekar . Claim 1. Sechenov University has completed clinical trails of COVID-19 vaccine. 2. Russia is the first country to complete COVID-19 vaccine human trials. Fact-check 1. Sechenov University has completed the first phase of clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine As per the World Health Organization , clinical trials are a type of research that study new tests and treatments and evaluate their effects on human health outcomes. There are 4 phases of biomedical clinical trials: Phase I studies usually test new drugs for the first time in a small group of people to evaluate a safe dosage range and identify side effects. Phase II studies test treatments that have been found to be safe in Phase I but now need a larger group of human subjects to monitor for any adverse effects. Phase III studies are conducted on larger populations and in different regions and countries and are often the step right before a new treatment is approved. Phase IV studies take place after country approval and there is a need for further testing in a wide population over a longer timeframe. On July 12, Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) reported, “The first stage of research on the vaccine at Sechenov University kicked off on June 18 when a group of 18 volunteers were vaccinated. The second group of 20 volunteers were vaccinated on June 23.” However, it’s pertinent to note that the first sentence of the report could have contributed to widespread misnformation. It said, “Clinical trials of vaccine against the novel coronavirus were completed on volunteers at Sechenov University.” According to Firstpost , “The vaccine is being developed and produced by the Gamaleya Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology along with the Russian defence ministry. The trials are being conducted in the Sechenov University.” The COVID-19 vaccine tracker created by the WHO states that the vaccine is in Phase 1/2 of clinical trials. “In the Russian vaccine trials, the first stage of research on the vaccine began on 18 June when a group of 18 volunteers were vaccinated. The second stage had 20 volunteers and they were vaccinated on 23 June,” reports Firstpost. The website ClinicalTrials.gov , which is a US registry of all the ongoing clinical studies, states that Phase I trials of the vaccine have been split into two stages. “The trials are split into two half as the two groups are being given different doses of the vaccine,” Firstpost further states. Thus Sechenov University has completed the first phase of clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine. 2. Russia is not the first country to conduct human trials On March 16, Associated Press had reported that the first human trials were conducted at the Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, US. According to WHO COVID-19 vaccine tracker, the institute has progressed to Phase 2 of clinical trials. Thus, the claim that Russia is the first country in the world to “complete” human trials is also false. Conclusion: Around July 12, several media outlets from all over the world reported that Russia’s Sechenov University has completed clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine. These reports also suggested that this is the first vaccine in the world to complete human trials. A list of media outlets that published such reports can be accessed here.

The image being circulated is a routine procedural blood draw for testing all production staff. ” Furthermore, in an interview with NDTV, Dr Krishna Ella, Chairman and MD of BBIL, said that human trials will start in 10 days. 2. BBV152 cannot be administered intravenously BBV152 was registered for clinical trials with ICMR’s Clinical Trials Registry. As per the registration document , the route of administration of the vaccine is an intramuscular injection . Intra-muscular vaccines are not given in the elbow pit region (cubital fossa) due to a lack of muscles in that area. The cubital fossa is used to access superficial nerves, arteries and veins for intravenous administration. Furthermore, as seen in the picture, the person is wearing a tourniquet rubber band on his arm. The band is used to put pressure on a patient’s arm to draw blood. This is a compression method, highly unlikely to be used while administering a vaccine. The band is used to pool blood or accumulate blood to draw it intravenously, and this pooling of blood is not required for intramuscular vaccine administrations. What are the different routes of administration of vaccines? Vaccines can be administered using three different routes of injection, oral administration (for example, rotavirus vaccine) and intranasal spray application (for example, flu vaccine). The different routes of injection — intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal — depend on the point of entry of the vaccine and the place where the action is desired. Intramuscular injection administers the vaccine into the muscle mass (shoulder, butt or thigh). Subcutaneous injection administers the vaccine into the subcutis, the layer above the muscle and below the skin. Intradermal injection administers the vaccine in the epidermis, the topmost layer of the skin. The graphic below from the World Health Organisation explains the three routes of administration of a vaccine via injection. Some examples of vaccines administered through intramuscular injection are the Hepatitis B vaccine and measles-rubella vaccine.

The distribution of Arsenicum Album 30 was done according to the previous AYUSH guidelines on COVID-19. In addition, state authorities in Kerala , Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and even Mumbai BMC has suggested the use of homeopathy prophylactically to increase immunity. Further, due to the lack of effective treatment and the growing number of COVID positive cases even during the lockdown period, Prime Minister Modi had emphasised to follow the AYUSH guidelines with homeopathy and Ayurveda for protection against COVID-19. These AYUSH guidelines released in January 2020 can be found on the PIB website ( link to the release here ). After facing criticism in India and internationally, the ministry of AYUSH released Annexure I & Annexure II , that quoted an Italian research review ( Bellavite et al. 2015 ) to stand behind the statements made earlier and to give proof of a mechanistic understanding of Arsenicum Album 30 in ‘boosting immunity’ against COVID-19. As a result, many now believe that homeopathic pills called Arsenicum album 30 increase the body’s natural defence mechanism. Since none of the homeopathic drugs has been scientifically demonstrated to produce proven action on cells and its receptors, the Central Council of Homeopathy (CCRH) uses “a wide-range mechanism of action review article” ( Bellavite et al. 2015 ) to prove that the homeopathy drugs indeed work in the claimed manner. This paper regularly quoted by CCRH claims to ‘review’ the hypotheses about homeopathic drug action at the cellular and molecular levels. We sci-checked this review paper’s relevant arguments about the drug Arsenicum album 30 that claims its ‘mechanism of action’. Claim: Homoeopathy drugs protect from the coronavirus by increasing the body’s innate immunity. Verdict: False Fact-check: Our body’s immune system is of two types: 1. Inherent or innate immunity This is our body’s own natural response to an external pathogen invasion. It is the kind of immunity which we are born with and does not deteriorate unless our body is subjected to immune altering drugs, diseases or process, a few examples of these could be – an HIV infection, a corticosteroid drug administration for immunosuppression or chronic insomnia. 2. Adaptive immunity This is the immunity that can be altered using natural or artificial factors. It could be acquired in a child through the mother during pregnancy, or via a later infection such as chickenpox; or, it could be through artificial means such as vaccination, and in some cases, antibody transfer from an immune positive individual to a non-infected person. How does homeopathy claim to interact with the immunity using Arsenicum album 30? Homeopathy has allegedly considered a method to activate or ‘boost’ the inherent or innate immunity of the person by consuming Arsenicum album 30 pills, which may incur the strength to our bodies to fight against external pathogens such as the coronavirus. These claims of homeopathy treatment were made on the basis of studies conducted in the human population that claimed to show a change in the expression of proteins such as inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The proteins are released in the body, and largely measured in the blood. The quantity of these proteins in the blood shows the extent of an existing infection or inflammation. Their release also shows a functional immune system and a reduced release during an active infection could show some immune-suppression because of disease or external drugs. The research quoted by CCRH on Arsenicum album 30 Below, we will review all the studies quoted in Bellavite et al. 2015 that suggest that Arsenicum album 30 helps to ‘boost’ our immune system by causing a change in the release of immune-proteins. 1. Claim of the Arsenicum album 30 as a protective compound for cellular damage against arsenic and UV induced toxicity via controlling genetic modulation. Studies De et al. 2012 , Das et al. 2012 & Das et al. 2011 were referenced to suggest that Arsenicum album 30 may reduce the toxicity of Arsenite in two bacterias E. coli and S. Cerevisae. Since these three referenced research studies were conducted on bacteria, and not conducted in infected humans or even in lab animals, they cannot be used as a proof of mechanism of action. Further, a study ( Marotti et al. 2014 ) conducted in wheat seedlings was used as proof of protection against genetic modulation by using Arsenicum. Firstly, they extracted RNA and conducted gene expression analysis from seeds of wheat. Gene expression is a method by which the information in the genes is used to instruct protein manufacturing in the body. Despite the results in this study, it cannot be applied to animal cells, or even live animals and humans. Secondly, a change in expression of the gene, i.e. the change in instructions for protein design, does not determine protective or toxic effects of a compound. Genes can be expressed in both scenarios, i.e. for the manufacturing proteins causing detriment, or, manufacturing proteins for the benefit of a living system. Thus, the research does not have sufficient data to prove that Arsenicum album 30 can modulate genetic expression to provide protection from cellular damage. 2. Claim of change in expression of specific immune-related proteins in such a way that “important genes (turn) on or off, initiating a cascade of gene actions to correct the gene expression that has gone wrong and produced the disorder or disease”- Bellavite et al. 2015 This claim means that, allegedly, a homeopathy drug will change the expression of immunity-related genes in our DNA, i.e. change the information that codes the protein design. It is claimed that the change due to the drug will be in such a way that the new protein manufactured (linked to immunity) will eventually ‘correct’ the initial gene expression. This initial gene expression, which will be corrected by this protein, is also allegedly the process which has caused the disease. This means that all diseases are caused by their corresponding gene expression and its protein manufacturing, and all cures can be initiated by changing the expression of immunity-related genes. This is a highly canonical argument as many diseases or disorders are unrelated to the genetic factors – environmental and other pathophysiologies play a huge role in treating diseases. This is the most widely quoted and accepted claim of homeopathy. Also, the discovery of homeopathy by Hanemann was in 1796 and did not come out in print until 1807 . However, the first experiment in inheritable units, now we call them genes, was not conducted by Gregor Mendel until 1857-1864, nearly 50 years after the discovery of homeopathy. The founder of homeopathy had died in 1843. So, the mechanism with which homeopathy works in the above research paper does not match on a timeline. Perhaps, Hanemann did not understand the modern mechanisms proposed for homeopathy, which have not been proven till date by homeopaths. The paper elaborated that ( Bellavite et al. 2015 ), “Mother tinctures and highly diluted drugs were tested in human tumour cell lines or cells challenged with carcinogens; they affected the modulation of the expression of specific mRNA markers (NF-κB, Akt, p53, Bax, Blc-2, caspase 3, Cyt-c) and increased tumour cell death ( Sunila et al. 2009 , Hofbauer et al. 2010 , Sikdar et al. 2014 & Mukherjee et al. 2013 ).” Protein markers such as NF-κB can be important in the regulation of innate or the body’s own immunity. However, referenced studies quoted to make such claims do not reflect the strength required to assert such a claim since the studies are not specific to Arsenicum album 30, and most of them in fact do not even refer to the said drug. For example, Sunila et al. 2009 does not have any mention of Arsenicum album 30 and the research was conducted in cultivated cell lines in the lab. Hofbauer et al. 2010 also did not mention arsenicum, while the effect was studied in bacteria. Further, the research in Sikdar et al. 2014 was conducted in cell lines as well as laboratory rats with lung cancer models, but did not mention homeopathic formulations or Arsenicum or infectious diseases. Finally, the study Mukherjee et al. 2013 mentions the use of another homeopathic drug called ‘Thuja’ in cancer cell lines acquired from the lungs of mice, while no mention of Arsenicum occurs. Thus, one of the most cited papers in homeopathy, specifically by the CCRH to prove that there is a mechanism of action with Arsenicum drugs, even though the testing hasn’t been conducted in COVID-19 patients, has no mention of Arsenicum album 30 in any of the quoted studies and have not been conducted in humans or in lab animals with infectious diseases. 3. Claim of highly toxic substances used in low doses as therapeutic formulations in homeopathy In the final claim, studies Betti et al. 1997 , Bode & Dong 2002 & Khuda-Bukhsh et al. 2011 , were referenced in the article ( Bellavite et al. 2015 ). Amongst the three referenced studies, Bode & Dong 2002 discussed undiluted arsenic which can either cause cancer as well as be therapeutic in cancer, the study Betti et al. 1997 was again a study of toxicity in wheat seedlings. And the final study Khuda-Bukhsh et al. 2011 , was the only one conducted in humans, but it was to determine the impact of Arsenicum album 30 on arsenic toxicity. Thus, no study in the review paper given in the ‘Annexure’ by AYUSH proves that low doses of arsenic or any other drug can be therapeutic. Further, it is evident from years of pharmacological research that the right amount of dose is imperative for the drug to have an effect. Conclusion: None of the studies mentioned in the Bellavite et al. 2015 review article proves that Arsenicum album 30 will boost immunity in humans or in animals to protect against infectious diseases. In fact, the claims of cell protection, genetic modulation or the high potency of low doses, has not been conducted systematically in any infectious disease models. Thus, homeopathy as an immune booster against COVID-19 remains heavily marketed and the most dangerous pseudoscience that the AYUSH ministry has produced during this pandemic. Our previous sci-check at Alt News Science reviewing and questioning the scientific literature on the mechanisms of homeopathy drugs can be found on this link . Further, we have also found that the claimed Arsenicum album 30 has never been tested in human infections in clinical trials ( link here ) to yield the results that the CCRH claims. The CCRH scientific advisory board had also confirmed that the medicine advised for recent coronavirus crisis (Arsenicum album 30) had been advised previously for the prevention of Influenza-like Illness ( Mathie et al. 2009 , Chakraborty et al. 2013 , Varanasi, Gupta, et al. 2019 ). Thus, the drug has neither been specifically developed for the current or previous coronavirus epidemics nor has been tested systematically for efficacy against any coronavirus infections. Besides the government and media’s dispersal of unchecked science on homeopathy, corporators have been buying the drug at a mass scale to protect themselves, their families and their communities to form ‘herd immunity’ via the administration of Arsenicum album 30. A corporate giant Rajiv Bajaj, Bajaj Auto suggested that Homeopathy and herd immunity, not lockdown , are the best strategy to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Although it may be possible to increase immunity via lifestyle changes, vitamin D, sleeping efficiently, etc. so far, no drugs have shown the evidence to ‘boost the immunity’ to protect against the COVID-19 pandemic. The most reliable method to protect against the infection is suggested hygiene, physical distancing from humans and fomites as well as using protective gear when required. Consumption of such untested drugs on such a large scale gives false protection and increases the spread of coronavirus, especially when the country has not been able to control the spread despite the enforcement of physical distancing. References: Overview: Despite the order from the Ministry of AYUSH to prevent the public advertisement of AYUSH-related claims for COVID-19, many Indian states, particularly larger cities such as Pune, Vadodara, Mumbai have been found distributing homeopathy drugs such as Arsenicum album 30 by both public and private means. The distribution of Arsenicum Album 30 was done according to the previous AYUSH guidelines on COVID-19. In addition, state authorities in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and even Mumbai BMC has suggested the use of homeopathy prophylactically to increase immunity. Further, due to the lack of effective treatment and the growing number of COVID positive cases even during the lockdown period, Prime Minister Modi had emphasised to follow the AYUSH guidelines with homeopathy and Ayurveda for protection against COVID-19. These AYUSH guidelines released in January 2020 can be found on the PIB website (link to the release here). After facing criticism in India and internationally, the ministry of AYUSH released Annexure I & Annexure II, that quoted an Italian research review (Bellavite et al. 2015) to stand behind the statements made earlier and to give proof of a mechanistic understanding of Arsenicum Album 30 in ‘boosting immunity’ against COVID-19. As a result, many now believe that homeopathic pills called Arsenicum album 30 increase the body’s natural defence mechanism. Since none of the homeopathic drugs has been scientifically demonstrated to produce proven action on cells and its receptors, the Central Council of Homeopathy (CCRH) uses “a wide-range mechanism of action review article” (Bellavite et al. 2015) to prove that the homeopathy drugs indeed work in the claimed manner. This paper regularly quoted by CCRH claims to ‘review’ the hypotheses about homeopathic drug action at the cellular and molecular levels. We sci-checked this review paper’s relevant arguments about the drug Arsenicum album 30 that claims its ‘mechanism of action’. Claim: Homoeopathy drugs protect from the coronavirus by increasing the body’s innate immunity. Verdict: False Fact-check: Our body’s immune system is of two types: 1. Inherent or innate immunity This is our body’s own natural response to an external pathogen invasion. It is the kind of immunity which we are born with and does not deteriorate unless our body is subjected to immune altering drugs, diseases or process, a few examples of these could be – an HIV infection, a corticosteroid drug administration for immunosuppression or chronic insomnia. 2. Adaptive immunity This is the immunity that can be altered using natural or artificial factors. It could be acquired in a child through the mother during pregnancy, or via a later infection such as chickenpox; or, it could be through artificial means such as vaccination, and in some cases, antibody transfer from an immune positive individual to a non-infected person. How does homeopathy claim to interact with the immunity using Arsenicum album 30? Homeopathy has allegedly considered a method to activate or ‘boost’ the inherent or innate immunity of the person by consuming Arsenicum album 30 pills, which may incur the strength to our bodies to fight against external pathogens such as the coronavirus. These claims of homeopathy treatment were made on the basis of studies conducted in the human population that claimed to show a change in the expression of proteins such as inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The proteins are released in the body, and largely measured in the blood. The quantity of these proteins in the blood shows the extent of an existing infection or inflammation. Their release also shows a functional immune system and a reduced release during an active infection could show some immune-suppression because of disease or external drugs. The research quoted by CCRH on Arsenicum album 30 Below, we will review all the studies quoted in Bellavite et al. 2015 that suggest that Arsenicum album 30 helps to ‘boost’ our immune system by causing a change in the release of immune-proteins. 1. Claim of the Arsenicum album 30 as a protective compound for cellular damage against arsenic and UV induced toxicity via controlling genetic modulation. Studies De et al. 2012, Das et al. 2012 & Das et al. 2011 were referenced to suggest that Arsenicum album 30 may reduce the toxicity of Arsenite in two bacterias E. coli and S. Cerevisae. Since these three referenced research studies were conducted on bacteria, and not conducted in infected humans or even in lab animals, they cannot be used as a proof of mechanism of action. Further, a study (Marotti et al. 2014) conducted in wheat seedlings was used as proof of protection against genetic modulation by using Arsenicum. Firstly, they extracted RNA and conducted gene expression analysis from seeds of wheat. Gene expression is a method by which the information in the genes is used to instruct protein manufacturing in the body. Despite the results in this study, it cannot be applied to animal cells, or even live animals and humans. Secondly, a change in expression of the gene, i.e. the change in instructions for protein design, does not determine protective or toxic effects of a compound. Genes can be expressed in both scenarios, i.e. for the manufacturing proteins causing detriment, or, manufacturing proteins for the benefit of a living system. Thus, the research does not have sufficient data to prove that Arsenicum album 30 can modulate genetic expression to provide protection from cellular damage. 2. Claim of change in expression of specific immune-related proteins in such a way that “important genes (turn) on or off, initiating a cascade of gene actions to correct the gene expression that has gone wrong and produced the disorder or disease”- Bellavite et al. 2015 This claim means that, allegedly, a homeopathy drug will change the expression of immunity-related genes in our DNA, i.e. change the information that codes the protein design. It is claimed that the change due to the drug will be in such a way that the new protein manufactured (linked to immunity) will eventually ‘correct’ the initial gene expression. This initial gene expression, which will be corrected by this protein, is also allegedly the process which has caused the disease. This means that all diseases are caused by their corresponding gene expression and its protein manufacturing, and all cures can be initiated by changing the expression of immunity-related genes. This is a highly canonical argument as many diseases or disorders are unrelated to the genetic factors – environmental and other pathophysiologies play a huge role in treating diseases. This is the most widely quoted and accepted claim of homeopathy. Also, the discovery of homeopathy by Hanemann was in 1796 and did not come out in print until 1807. However, the first experiment in inheritable units, now we call them genes, was not conducted by Gregor Mendel until 1857-1864, nearly 50 years after the discovery of homeopathy. The founder of homeopathy had died in 1843. So, the mechanism with which homeopathy works in the above research paper does not match on a timeline. Perhaps, Hanemann did not understand the modern mechanisms proposed for homeopathy, which have not been proven till date by homeopaths. The paper elaborated that (Bellavite et al. 2015), “Mother tinctures and highly diluted drugs were tested in human tumour cell lines or cells challenged with carcinogens; they affected the modulation of the expression of specific mRNA markers (NF-κB, Akt, p53, Bax, Blc-2, caspase 3, Cyt-c) and increased tumour cell death (Sunila et al. 2009, Hofbauer et al. 2010, Sikdar et al. 2014 & Mukherjee et al. 2013).” Protein markers such as NF-κB can be important in the regulation of innate or the body’s own immunity. However, referenced studies quoted to make such claims do not reflect the strength required to assert such a claim since the studies are not specific to Arsenicum album 30, and most of them in fact do not even refer to the said drug. For example, Sunila et al. 2009 does not have any mention of Arsenicum album 30 and the research was conducted in cultivated cell lines in the lab. Hofbauer et al. 2010 also did not mention arsenicum, while the effect was studied in bacteria. Further, the research in Sikdar et al. 2014 was conducted in cell lines as well as laboratory rats with lung cancer models, but did not mention homeopathic formulations or Arsenicum or infectious diseases. Finally, the study Mukherjee et al. 2013 mentions the use of another homeopathic drug called ‘Thuja’ in cancer cell lines acquired from the lungs of mice, while no mention of Arsenicum occurs. Thus, one of the most cited papers in homeopathy, specifically by the CCRH to prove that there is a mechanism of action with Arsenicum drugs, even though the testing hasn’t been conducted in COVID-19 patients, has no mention of Arsenicum album 30 in any of the quoted studies and have not been conducted in humans or in lab animals with infectious diseases. 3. Claim of highly toxic substances used in low doses as therapeutic formulations in homeopathy In the final claim, studies Betti et al. 1997, Bode & Dong 2002 & Khuda-Bukhsh et al. 2011, were referenced in the article (Bellavite et al. 2015). Amongst the three referenced studies, Bode & Dong 2002 discussed undiluted arsenic which can either cause cancer as well as be therapeutic in cancer, the study Betti et al. 1997 was again a study of toxicity in wheat seedlings. And the final study Khuda-Bukhsh et al. 2011, was the only one conducted in humans, but it was to determine the impact of Arsenicum album 30 on arsenic toxicity. Thus, no study in the review paper given in the ‘Annexure’ by AYUSH proves that low doses of arsenic or any other drug can be therapeutic. Further, it is evident from years of pharmacological research that the right amount of dose is imperative for the drug to have an effect. Conclusion: None of the studies mentioned in the Bellavite et al. 2015 review article proves that Arsenicum album 30 will boost immunity in humans or in animals to protect against infectious diseases. In fact, the claims of cell protection, genetic modulation or the high potency of low doses, has not been conducted systematically in any infectious disease models.

The channel has promoted and given Arora a platform during several broadcasts. In the viral video, Arora appeals to the people of Hindu faith to include home ‘remedies’ like clove, black pepper, caraway ( ajwain ) and hot water in daily religious activities to fight against coronavirus infection. However, Arora isn’t the only individual promoting such ‘home remedies’ to prevent or cure Covid-19. #चाय और बड़ों की #राय समय-समय पर लेते रहना चाहिए !! ☕️☕️ कोरोना वायरस के संक्रमण से बचाव के लिए शरीर का इम्यून सिस्टम मजबूत होना जरूरी है।तुलसी,लौंग,काली मिर्च,इलायची,अदरक,और सौंफ वाली चाय से आपका इम्यून सिस्टम भी मजबूत होगा। #जयश्रीराम pic.twitter.com/BU0B8wUvIr — Sangeeta Bhandari (@sbhandari16) June 25, 2020 Since the virus outbreak, the government has been advising people to drink kadha.

Posted by Jay Monroe on Friday, 13 March 2020 This article contains scientific research to prove the efficacy behind these claims as a coronavirus treatment. In the absence of evidence against the COVID-19, we reviewed the research for these remedies against the symptoms of COVID-19 or against the treatment for any other viral infectious diseases of the upper respiratory system. CLAIM: Alt News Science dissected this video and other social media claims to list three distinct advises on prevention/ cure of coronavirus. The Hindi audio in Arora’s video has been translated. 1. Claims against the coronavirus infection by treating the upper respiratory tract with home remedies “On day 1 of infection, the virus is weakly attached in our oral cavity (mouth and throat). By slow consumption of hot water, the virus will travel through and reach the stomach where it will be destroyed by the stomach’s acidic environment.” “The consumption of clove, black pepper, or caraway with a pinch of salt thrice a day will protect against the virus while the infection is still in the oral cavity.” “Gargling with a pinch of turmeric and equal amounts of rock salt with hot water before bedtime will destroy the virus if it is in the upper respiratory tract or the throat.” “Steaming from the water with turmeric and rock salt will clear the virus from the nasal activity (inside the nose).” 2. Claims regarding immunity and coronavirus infection “Consumption of dry grapes with milk or water will boost one’s immunity.” “Consumption of cashew and almonds during summer can cause indigestion.” “Consume large amounts of paitha (winter melon or wax gourd) for immunity.” 3. Claims of using a herbal mix when the infection becomes systemic (reaches the blood) “Consuming a mixture of garlic, black pepper, big cardamom, clove, cinnamon, holy basil (tulsi), liquorice, long pepper in any combination with water will help, if the infection has reached the circulatory system (via blood).” VERDICT: False FACT-CHECK: 1. Claims against the coronavirus infection by treating the upper respiratory tract with home remedies. Let us first briefly discuss the way the virus establishes infection in our body. The novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2) is transmitted predominantly by respiratory droplets, contact, and potentially by the faecal-oral route. After the virus enters the nasal cavity and pharynx (upper respiratory tract), it attaches to the outermost layer of the cells lining the respiratory tract called the ‘epithelial cells’ (see figure). The SARS-COV2 attaches to these cells via a protein called ‘Spike protein’ that attaches to a receptor molecule called ACE2 located on the epithelial cell surface. Once the virus enters these cells, it multiplies by invading further down the respiratory tract, lungs, digestive tract lining, blood, and from there on to the other vital organs of the body. Thus, throughout this process, the virus is multiplying inside a number of cells in many important organs of the body and the blood. Therefore, by drinking hot water, washing it down, gargling or steaming with any other substances will not destroy the virus since it is not limited to the respiratory tract. Also, if Arora meant the tips are only applicable to day 1, many symptoms are not visible on day 1. There is a strong possibility that infected people will not know whether they have been infected . Thus, since the virus infects many organs of the body, and unlike the loosely attached inert dust particles in the respiratory tract, it cannot be ‘washed down’ or ‘cleaned’ with liquids in the upper respiratory tract. Also, the virus is present in the epithelial lining of the stomach, which has a high acidic content. Exposing the virus to the acid in the stomach would have no effect on the virus or against the infection . Therefore, drinking, gargling or steaming hot water, even if the water is mixed with herbs such as turmeric or salt, will not destroy the virus . Such home remedies may provide temporary symptomatic relief from a sore throat, but it doesn’t affect the virus or treat the infection. It is a complementary measure for common cold, akin to cold water sponges for fevers. Alt News Science had debunked the claim of gargling with hot water while countering another viral claim here . 2. Claims regarding immunity and coronavirus infection Dry grapes or raisins Raisins have been quoted due to their plant-based flavonoid called ‘Quercetin’ (a plant pigment) found in grapes that have been implicated as an immune-modulatory compound ( Yao et al 2016 ). However, a randomised clinical trial in 1002 participants that consumed 500-1000 mg/day pure quercetin did not have any influence on the infection of the respiratory tract as compared to a placebo drug ( Heinz et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, the amount of quercetin in red grapes is found to be 3.54 mg/100 gm ( www.quercetin.com ). Even if we assume that consumption of quercetin is effective, one would have to consume 1.4-2.8 kgs of grapes daily to reach the 500-1000 per day requirement of the aforementioned study. This may be nearly impossible for most people. Paitha (winter melon, wax gourd or Benincasa hispida) There is no literature that suggests that consumption of melon gourd or raisins will help with coronavirus or any other upper respiratory tract infections. 3. Claims of using a herbal mix when the infection becomes systemic (reaches the blood) Arora claimed that a mixture of garlic, black pepper, big cardamom, clove, cinnamon, holy basil, liquorice and long pepper with water will help fight COVID-19 if the infection has become systemic. We will discuss each of the herbs below and evaluate their efficacy against coronavirus of any other upper respiratory tract infections. Pepper The claim of using pepper against COVID-19 has been previously debunked WHO (see infographic). Garlic Despite garlic having some antibacterial effects, there is no evidence that it will prevent COVID-19 (see infographic). Cardamom Several in-vitro (lab) studies and studies in mice demonstrate the antibiotic and antifungal activity of the cardamom extracts ( Ashokkumar, K. et al 2020 ). However, there are no clinical studies done for cardamom extracts against any infection. Clove There are no clinical studies done for clove extracts against any infection. A similar claim regarding the ability of clove to cure COVID-19 has been debunked by Poynter, a fact-checking platform. Cinnamon Despite some studies suggesting antibacterial activity of cinnamon against bacteria like Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus plantarum and inhibition of fungal infections such as candidiasis, the evidence needed more validation since it is based on flakey preliminary data ( Ulbricht, C. et al 2011) . However, there are no clinical studies for cinnamon extracts against viral infections. Liquorice The active compound of liquorice is Glycyrrhizin which has shown antiviral activity against different viruses including herpes simplex, Varicella zoster , Japanese encephalitis, influenza, and vesicular stomatitis virus ( L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015 ). In a 2003 in-vitro study (in a culture of cells), glycyrrhizin was shown to inhibit the previous SARS-COV1 virus ( Cinatl J et al 2003 ). However, until there is a peer-reviewed randomized clinical trial in humans evaluating liquorice for the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2), its efficacy cannot be considered. Holy basil There have been 2 clinical studies of holy basil against viral infections and both have very poor methodological quality. The first study by Rajalakshmi et al (1986) did not have a control group, The second study by Das et al (1983) has a similar drawback of a very small sample size of 14 cases of viral encephalitis. Large sample sizes ensure that the chance variations are minimized or cancelled out. With low sample sizes, random events (e.g. recovery by chance) in a small number of subjects greatly impact the results. When a drug is administered to a group of patients and some of them recover, it cannot be known whether they improved due to placebo effect or due to their innate immunity or as a natural course of the disease. To minimise the impact of all such factors, studies are controlled, i.e, there is a control group of patients with similar characteristics and who have the same disease but who do not get the drug being tested. Hence, the results of uncontrolled studies with small sample size are considered unreliable. Thus, there is no evidence that consumption of pepper, garlic, clove, cinnamon, cardamom, liquorice, holy basil will cure the novel coronavirus. Further, consumption of these herbs in excess may develop unwanted side effects due to the toxicity of its active ingredients in high doses. CONCLUSION: While Indian hospitals struggle to handle the increasing number of novel coronavirus cases, it is a greatly appealing idea for the masses that they can prevent the infection or treat it on their own with home remedies. However, except the general commentary on masks and social distancing, none of the remedies claimed by Arora has any merit. Furthermore, he does not give any consideration to the amount of consumption, which may add to negative side effects due to toxicity of some herbs, and in fact, encourages people to use these spices as much as possible. This is a dangerous myth that ayurvedic remedies do not have side effects. The AYUSH ministry has already been promoting various herbs that have not been scientifically tested. In addition, viral videos, WhatsApp messages containing quick-fix home remedies overwhelm people who may be willing to try these untested cures to prevent and treat the disease on their own.

A person called Dheeraj Sharma posted a viral video on Facebook of Dr Parameshwar Arora MD (Ayurveda), a senior consultant at Sir Gangaram hospital, New Delhi addressing passersby on the street. Arora can be seen claiming in the video that he has five tips to prevent coronavirus. He even offers personal treatment to anyone who, despite following his tips with conviction, gets the viral infection. On Dheeraj Sharma’s account, the video had 12 million views and over 3 lakh shares at the time of writing this article. Baat Manoge to corona nhi hoga | DR Parmeshwar Arora ,Ganga Raam Hospital क्या बीतेगी अगर आपके ghar में corona हो gaya तो dhyaan से सुनिए Dr. Saab की बात अगर मानें तो corona नहीं होगा ￼| DR Parmeshwar Arora ,Ganga Raam Hospital Posted by Dheeraj Sharma on Wednesday, 3 June 2020 ABP News also shared this video clip on their YouTube channel along with their interview with Arora. The channel has promoted and given Arora a platform during several broadcasts. In the viral video, Arora appeals to the people of Hindu faith to include home ‘remedies’ like clove, black pepper, caraway (ajwain) and hot water in daily religious activities to fight against coronavirus infection. However, Arora isn’t the only individual promoting such ‘home remedies’ to prevent or cure Covid-19. #चाय और बड़ों की #राय समय-समय पर लेते रहना चाहिए !! ☕️☕️ कोरोना वायरस के संक्रमण से बचाव के लिए शरीर का इम्यून सिस्टम मजबूत होना जरूरी है।तुलसी,लौंग,काली मिर्च,इलायची,अदरक,और सौंफ वाली चाय से आपका इम्यून सिस्टम भी मजबूत होगा। #जयश्रीराम pic.twitter.com/BU0B8wUvIr — Sangeeta Bhandari (@sbhandari16) June 25, 2020 Since the virus outbreak, the government has been advising people to drink kadha. This was also amplified by the media. Clove and black pepper are some of the ingredients used to make this Ayurvedic recipe. कोरोना के खिलाफ़ जंग में योग के बाद आयुर्वेदिक काढ़ा भी उतर गया है, अब सैशे में भी मिलेगा काढ़ा पाउडर। ज़्यादा जानकारी के लिए देखिए @mewatisanjoo की रिपोर्ट अन्य #ReporterDiary के लिए क्लिक करें: https://t.co/mf6keLW7vJ#IndiaFightsCorona #COVID19 #Ayurveda pic.twitter.com/8hu5uo1nql — AajTak (@aajtak) June 5, 2020 Consumption of or gargling with warm salted water is also widespread claim. Posted by Jay Monroe on Friday, 13 March 2020 This article contains scientific research to prove the efficacy behind these claims as a coronavirus treatment. In the absence of evidence against the COVID-19, we reviewed the research for these remedies against the symptoms of COVID-19 or against the treatment for any other viral infectious diseases of the upper respiratory system. CLAIM: Alt News Science dissected this video and other social media claims to list three distinct advises on prevention/ cure of coronavirus. The Hindi audio in Arora’s video has been translated. 1. Claims against the coronavirus infection by treating the upper respiratory tract with home remedies “On day 1 of infection, the virus is weakly attached in our oral cavity (mouth and throat). By slow consumption of hot water, the virus will travel through and reach the stomach where it will be destroyed by the stomach’s acidic environment.” “The consumption of clove, black pepper, or caraway with a pinch of salt thrice a day will protect against the virus while the infection is still in the oral cavity.” “Gargling with a pinch of turmeric and equal amounts of rock salt with hot water before bedtime will destroy the virus if it is in the upper respiratory tract or the throat.” “Steaming from the water with turmeric and rock salt will clear the virus from the nasal activity (inside the nose).” 2. Claims regarding immunity and coronavirus infection “Consumption of dry grapes with milk or water will boost one’s immunity.” “Consumption of cashew and almonds during summer can cause indigestion.” “Consume large amounts of paitha (winter melon or wax gourd) for immunity.” 3. Claims of using a herbal mix when the infection becomes systemic (reaches the blood) “Consuming a mixture of garlic, black pepper, big cardamom, clove, cinnamon, holy basil (tulsi), liquorice, long pepper in any combination with water will help, if the infection has reached the circulatory system (via blood).” VERDICT: False FACT-CHECK: 1. Claims against the coronavirus infection by treating the upper respiratory tract with home remedies. Let us first briefly discuss the way the virus establishes infection in our body. The novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2) is transmitted predominantly by respiratory droplets, contact, and potentially by the faecal-oral route. After the virus enters the nasal cavity and pharynx (upper respiratory tract), it attaches to the outermost layer of the cells lining the respiratory tract called the ‘epithelial cells’ (see figure). The SARS-COV2 attaches to these cells via a protein called ‘Spike protein’ that attaches to a receptor molecule called ACE2 located on the epithelial cell surface. Once the virus enters these cells, it multiplies by invading further down the respiratory tract, lungs, digestive tract lining, blood, and from there on to the other vital organs of the body. Thus, throughout this process, the virus is multiplying inside a number of cells in many important organs of the body and the blood. Therefore, by drinking hot water, washing it down, gargling or steaming with any other substances will not destroy the virus since it is not limited to the respiratory tract. Also, if Arora meant the tips are only applicable to day 1, many symptoms are not visible on day 1. There is a strong possibility that infected people will not know whether they have been infected. Thus, since the virus infects many organs of the body, and unlike the loosely attached inert dust particles in the respiratory tract, it cannot be ‘washed down’ or ‘cleaned’ with liquids in the upper respiratory tract. Also, the virus is present in the epithelial lining of the stomach, which has a high acidic content. Exposing the virus to the acid in the stomach would have no effect on the virus or against the infection. Therefore, drinking, gargling or steaming hot water, even if the water is mixed with herbs such as turmeric or salt, will not destroy the virus. Such home remedies may provide temporary symptomatic relief from a sore throat, but it doesn’t affect the virus or treat the infection. It is a complementary measure for common cold, akin to cold water sponges for fevers. Alt News Science had debunked the claim of gargling with hot water while countering another viral claim here. 2. Claims regarding immunity and coronavirus infection Dry grapes or raisins Raisins have been quoted due to their plant-based flavonoid called ‘Quercetin’ (a plant pigment) found in grapes that have been implicated as an immune-modulatory compound (Yao et al 2016). However, a randomised clinical trial in 1002 participants that consumed 500-1000 mg/day pure quercetin did not have any influence on the infection of the respiratory tract as compared to a placebo drug (Heinz et al. 2010). Furthermore, the amount of quercetin in red grapes is found to be 3.54 mg/100 gm (www.quercetin.com). Even if we assume that consumption of quercetin is effective, one would have to consume 1.4-2.8 kgs of grapes daily to reach the 500-1000 per day requirement of the aforementioned study. This may be nearly impossible for most people. Paitha (winter melon, wax gourd or Benincasa hispida) There is no literature that suggests that consumption of melon gourd or raisins will help with coronavirus or any other upper respiratory tract infections. 3. Claims of using a herbal mix when the infection becomes systemic (reaches the blood) Arora claimed that a mixture of garlic, black pepper, big cardamom, clove, cinnamon, holy basil, liquorice and long pepper with water will help fight COVID-19 if the infection has become systemic. We will discuss each of the herbs below and evaluate their efficacy against coronavirus of any other upper respiratory tract infections. Pepper The claim of using pepper against COVID-19 has been previously debunked WHO (see infographic). Garlic Despite garlic having some antibacterial effects, there is no evidence that it will prevent COVID-19 (see infographic). Cardamom Several in-vitro (lab) studies and studies in mice demonstrate the antibiotic and antifungal activity of the cardamom extracts (Ashokkumar, K. et al 2020). However, there are no clinical studies done for cardamom extracts against any infection. Clove There are no clinical studies done for clove extracts against any infection. A similar claim regarding the ability of clove to cure COVID-19 has been debunked by Poynter, a fact-checking platform. Cinnamon Despite some studies suggesting antibacterial activity of cinnamon against bacteria like Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus plantarum and inhibition of fungal infections such as candidiasis, the evidence needed more validation since it is based on flakey preliminary data (Ulbricht, C. et al 2011). However, there are no clinical studies for cinnamon extracts against viral infections. Liquorice The active compound of liquorice is Glycyrrhizin which has shown antiviral activity against different viruses including herpes simplex, Varicella zoster, Japanese encephalitis, influenza, and vesicular stomatitis virus (L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015). In a 2003 in-vitro study (in a culture of cells), glycyrrhizin was shown to inhibit the previous SARS-COV1 virus (Cinatl J et al 2003). However, until there is a peer-reviewed randomized clinical trial in humans evaluating liquorice for the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV2), its efficacy cannot be considered. Holy basil There have been 2 clinical studies of holy basil against viral infections and both have very poor methodological quality. The first study by Rajalakshmi et al (1986) did not have a control group, The second study by Das et al (1983) has a similar drawback of a very small sample size of 14 cases of viral encephalitis. Large sample sizes ensure that the chance variations are minimized or cancelled out. With low sample sizes, random events (e.g. recovery by chance) in a small number of subjects greatly impact the results. When a drug is administered to a group of patients and some of them recover, it cannot be known whether they improved due to placebo effect or due to their innate immunity or as a natural course of the disease. To minimise the impact of all such factors, studies are controlled, i.e, there is a control group of patients with similar characteristics and who have the same disease but who do not get the drug being tested. Hence, the results of uncontrolled studies with small sample size are considered unreliable. Thus, there is no evidence that consumption of pepper, garlic, clove, cinnamon, cardamom, liquorice, holy basil will cure the novel coronavirus. Further, consumption of these herbs in excess may develop unwanted side effects due to the toxicity of its active ingredients in high doses. CONCLUSION: While Indian hospitals struggle to handle the increasing number of novel coronavirus cases, it is a greatly appealing idea for the masses that they can prevent the infection or treat it on their own with home remedies. However, except the general commentary on masks and social distancing, none of the remedies claimed by Arora has any merit. Furthermore, he does not give any consideration to the amount of consumption, which may add to negative side effects due to toxicity of some herbs, and in fact, encourages people to use these spices as much as possible. This is a dangerous myth that ayurvedic remedies do not have side effects. The AYUSH ministry has already been promoting various herbs that have not been scientifically tested. In addition, viral videos, WhatsApp messages containing quick-fix home remedies overwhelm people who may be willing to try these untested cures to prevent and treat the disease on their own.

Indian media outlets ran shows on the kit, referring to it as a ‘breakthrough’ in coronavirus...",Coronil is 100% cure for COVID-19,"Subsequently, the AYUSH ministry issued a statement that Patanjali Ayurved has been asked not to advertise the drug as a cure for COVID-19 due to the lack of documents (i.e. proof of efficacy). Ramdev claimed in an interview with India Today that by evening, AYUSH will be sent all the documents related to the research that has been used as the basis of the proof of efficacy for Coronil kit. Patanjali released a set of documents that included: The previously circulating clinical trial registry document (CTRI), which was registered on May 20, 2020. A letter to the AYUSH drug policy section that detailed the composition of the drug, the details of the clinical trial and where it was conducted. Two links of the research articles enlisted within the composition of the drug. And letters of the ethics approval committee, and two FYI letters to the Director-General, CCRAS and Additional Chief Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Thus, apart from the CTRI, only the two research articles were listed as proof of efficacy that the drug provides 100% cure from COVID-19. Further, the license officer of Ayurved Department in Uttarakhand has stated that Patanjali’s application was approved for use as an immunity booster and not a drug for COVID-19. In this sci-check, we will look at the composition of Coronil kit and the two studies listed in the Patanjali document. Claim: The Coronil kit by Patanjali Ayurved is a 100% cure of COVID-19 and has been scientifically tested with clinical trials. Verdict: False Fact-Check: The Coronil Kit contains three bottles of: Swasari Ras tablets or (DRS) — a herb mixture tablet. The herb mixture is two-part Giloy, one part Ashwagandha and one part Tulsi. Anu Taila (nasal oil drops). Apart from the CTRI which is a registration of the Clinical Trial (not a published RCT study), only the two research studies were listed in the document given to AYUSH as proof of efficacy of the drug. None of these studies was the published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as stated by Patanjali. Among the two studies, the first was related to tablet 1 (DRS) in the kit, and the second study was related to only one of the herbs in the Coronil tablet called Giloy. There were no studies in the document provided for Ashwagandha and Tulsi, the other two components of the Coronil tablet. Also, no study was provided for the third drug in the kit Anu Taila (nasal oil drops). Further, the CTRI document suggested that 120 COVID-19 infected patients received Coronil treatment and Patanjali has claimed that they were successfully cured at the rate of 100%. However, the CTRI document is only proof of registration of the clinical trial and not proof of results found within the trial. Proof of efficacy should be a published, peer-reviewed study by the research standards in a sizable population. In addition, the following two studies were referenced as the scientific evidence by Patanjali to prove the efficacy of Swasari Ras (1st drug of the kit) and Giloy (a part of Coronil tablet or 2nd drug of the kit) for COVID-19. Study 1 : Balkrishna, A., Solleti, S. K., Singh, H., Tomer, M., Sharma, N., & Varshney, A. (2020). Calcio-herbal formulation, Divya-Swasari-Ras, alleviates chronic inflammation and suppresses airway remodelling in mouse model of allergic asthma by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, 126, 110063. This study evaluated the effect of Swasari Ras or Divya Swasari Ras (DSR), in mice (not humans) induced in a lab in an allergic asthma model. The drug DSR has neither been tested on inflammatory lung tissue with coronavirus nor was it tested on humans. Allergic Asthma, on which DSR was tested on as part of this study and the disease due to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) are completely different diseases, and the mechanisms of the diseases are different as well. Moreover, since the tests for DSR are conducted in non-human species, the study cannot be used as a 100% proof to claim the efficacy of DSR against COVID-19. Study 2 : Acharya Balkrishna, SUBARNA POKHREL, Anurag Varshney. Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy) may curb COVID-19 contagion: Tinocordiside disrupts the electrostatic interactions between ACE2 and RBD. Authorea. April 16, 2020. DOI: 10.22541/au.158707095.53639175 The second study is a preprint (i.e. a non-peer-reviewed article), which hasn’t been reviewed by other scientists to ascertain its scientific validity. During this pandemic, there are many pre-prints available due to the speed of the information necessary to hasten the research process. This particular study released by Patanjali Ayurved as a 100% proof of efficacy for Coronil tablet is a molecular study of Giloy herb (Tinospora Cordifolia) through a computer simulation and is not a study on any living species, mice or humans. Since the Coronavirus (SARS-COV2) binds to the host cell in humans via its ACE receptor using a spike protein, the study claims that Giloy disrupts this binding by interrupting its electrostatic interactions between the ACE receptor and the receptor-binding protein (RBD) (see image). Both ACE receptors and spike protein RBD are the proteins used by SARS-COV2 to gain entry into the cell. The study is simply a molecular dynamics (MD) ‘simulation’ which is a computer simulation, and in this case, was conducted using software called Discovery Studio, Biovia . While the study needs peer-review, it is neither a ‘clinical trial’ as claimed by Ramdev or Patanjali, nor does it explore the interactions between the two proteins in humans or any other living species Conclusion: Therefore, none of the scientific proofs given by Patanjali suggests that Coronil is an effective treatment for COVID-19 for the following reasons: The documents provided have published research study for only one out of the three drugs in the Coronil kit, and a non-peer-reviewed study for only a part of the herbal mix (Giloy) of three-herb Coronil drug. As per the manufacturing or approval of evidence-based medicine, a non-peer review study for only a part of the drug cannot be taken as proof of efficacy for the Coronil tablet. The first research study for Swasari Ras (DSR) is a study on mice and not humans. Also, the second research study for Giloy is a computer simulation and not a study on any living species. The clinical trial registry document (CTRI) provided is only a proof of registration and not proof of results found within the trial. Further, no toxicity or herbal interaction study was conducted to prove that the drug combination was safe or effective in COVID-19 patients. In fact, claiming that such untested drugs will cure a 100% of COVID-19 patients amounts to a false assumption of treatment and depletes them of the opportunity to receive proven treatment where necessary, even though they may not always treat every patient. This practice of false drug manufacturing under the garb of ancient ayurveda endangers the lives of people during the times of a global crisis. Balkrishna, A., Solleti, S. K., Singh, H., Tomer, M., Sharma, N., & Varshney, A. (2020). Calcio-herbal Formulation, Divya-Swasari-Ras, Alleviates Chronic Inflammation and Suppresses Airway Remodelling in Mouse Model of Allergic Asthma by Modulating Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Response. Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy. 2020 Jun;126:110063.doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110063 Patanjali Ayurved launched an ayurvedic treatment kit called ‘Coronil’ as a ‘cure’ for COVID-19. Indian media outlets ran shows on the kit, referring to it as a ‘breakthrough’ in coronavirus treatment. Ram Kisan Yadav, popularly known as Baba Ramdev, the face of Patanjali, stated that the kit was developed using “clinically controlled trial” and claimed that it was a “100% cure for COVID-19”. Further, Ramdev stated that they had all the required permissions for manufacturing and releasing the drug. Subsequently, the AYUSH ministry issued a statement that Patanjali Ayurved has been asked not to advertise the drug as a cure for COVID-19 due to the lack of documents (i.e. proof of efficacy). Ramdev claimed in an interview with India Today that by evening, AYUSH will be sent all the documents related to the research that has been used as the basis of the proof of efficacy for Coronil kit. Patanjali released a set of documents that included: The previously circulating clinical trial registry document (CTRI), which was registered on May 20, 2020. A letter to the AYUSH drug policy section that detailed the composition of the drug, the details of the clinical trial and where it was conducted. Two links of the research articles enlisted within the composition of the drug. And letters of the ethics approval committee, and two FYI letters to the Director-General, CCRAS and Additional Chief Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Thus, apart from the CTRI, only the two research articles were listed as proof of efficacy that the drug provides 100% cure from COVID-19. Further, the license officer of Ayurved Department in Uttarakhand has stated that Patanjali’s application was approved for use as an immunity booster and not a drug for COVID-19. In this sci-check, we will look at the composition of Coronil kit and the two studies listed in the Patanjali document. Claim: The Coronil kit by Patanjali Ayurved is a 100% cure of COVID-19 and has been scientifically tested with clinical trials. Verdict: False Fact-Check: The Coronil Kit contains three bottles of: Swasari Ras tablets or (DRS) — a herb mixture tablet. The herb mixture is two-part Giloy, one part Ashwagandha and one part Tulsi. Anu Taila (nasal oil drops). Apart from the CTRI which is a registration of the Clinical Trial (not a published RCT study), only the two research studies were listed in the document given to AYUSH as proof of efficacy of the drug. None of these studies was the published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as stated by Patanjali. Among the two studies, the first was related to tablet 1 (DRS) in the kit, and the second study was related to only one of the herbs in the Coronil tablet called Giloy. There were no studies in the document provided for Ashwagandha and Tulsi, the other two components of the Coronil tablet. Also, no study was provided for the third drug in the kit Anu Taila (nasal oil drops). Further, the CTRI document suggested that 120 COVID-19 infected patients received Coronil treatment and Patanjali has claimed that they were successfully cured at the rate of 100%. However, the CTRI document is only proof of registration of the clinical trial and not proof of results found within the trial. Proof of efficacy should be a published, peer-reviewed study by the research standards in a sizable population. In addition, the following two studies were referenced as the scientific evidence by Patanjali to prove the efficacy of Swasari Ras (1st drug of the kit) and Giloy (a part of Coronil tablet or 2nd drug of the kit) for COVID-19. Study 1: Balkrishna, A., Solleti, S. K., Singh, H., Tomer, M., Sharma, N., & Varshney, A. (2020). Calcio-herbal formulation, Divya-Swasari-Ras, alleviates chronic inflammation and suppresses airway remodelling in mouse model of allergic asthma by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, 126, 110063. This study evaluated the effect of Swasari Ras or Divya Swasari Ras (DSR), in mice (not humans) induced in a lab in an allergic asthma model. The drug DSR has neither been tested on inflammatory lung tissue with coronavirus nor was it tested on humans. Allergic Asthma, on which DSR was tested on as part of this study and the disease due to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) are completely different diseases, and the mechanisms of the diseases are different as well. Moreover, since the tests for DSR are conducted in non-human species, the study cannot be used as a 100% proof to claim the efficacy of DSR against COVID-19. Study 2: Acharya Balkrishna, SUBARNA POKHREL, Anurag Varshney. Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy) may curb COVID-19 contagion: Tinocordiside disrupts the electrostatic interactions between ACE2 and RBD. Authorea. April 16, 2020. DOI: 10.22541/au.158707095.53639175 The second study is a preprint (i.e. a non-peer-reviewed article), which hasn’t been reviewed by other scientists to ascertain its scientific validity. During this pandemic, there are many pre-prints available due to the speed of the information necessary to hasten the research process. This particular study released by Patanjali Ayurved as a 100% proof of efficacy for Coronil tablet is a molecular study of Giloy herb (Tinospora Cordifolia) through a computer simulation and is not a study on any living species, mice or humans. Image source: The conversation Since the Coronavirus (SARS-COV2) binds to the host cell in humans via its ACE receptor using a spike protein, the study claims that Giloy disrupts this binding by interrupting its electrostatic interactions between the ACE receptor and the receptor-binding protein (RBD) (see image). Both ACE receptors and spike protein RBD are the proteins used by SARS-COV2 to gain entry into the cell. The study is simply a molecular dynamics (MD) ‘simulation’ which is a computer simulation, and in this case, was conducted using software called Discovery Studio, Biovia. While the study needs peer-review, it is neither a ‘clinical trial’ as claimed by Ramdev or Patanjali, nor does it explore the interactions between the two proteins in humans or any other living species Conclusion: Therefore, none of the scientific proofs given by Patanjali suggests that Coronil is an effective treatment for COVID-19 for the following reasons: The documents provided have published research study for only one out of the three drugs in the Coronil kit, and a non-peer-reviewed study for only a part of the herbal mix (Giloy) of three-herb Coronil drug. As per the manufacturing or approval of evidence-based medicine, a non-peer review study for only a part of the drug cannot be taken as proof of efficacy for the Coronil tablet. The first research study for Swasari Ras (DSR) is a study on mice and not humans. Also, the second research study for Giloy is a computer simulation and not a study on any living species. The clinical trial registry document (CTRI) provided is only a proof of registration and not proof of results found within the trial. Further, no toxicity or herbal interaction study was conducted to prove that the drug combination was safe or effective in COVID-19 patients. In fact, claiming that such untested drugs will cure a 100% of COVID-19 patients amounts to a false assumption of treatment and depletes them of the opportunity to receive proven treatment where necessary, even though they may not always treat every patient. This practice of false drug manufacturing under the garb of ancient ayurveda endangers the lives of people during the times of a global crisis. References: Balkrishna, A., Solleti, S.

This time the phone rang and we learnt that the number corresponds to Sir Ganga Ram Coalmet Hospital in Rajinder Nagar. The front office staff shared with us the number of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) and we subsequently connected with on-duty doctor Varun who confirmed that the hospital has not released such a document. He said that it could be photoshopped. When we asked about Dr Aggarwal, Varun said that he is associated with SGRH but has not issued the prescription. On June 12, Dr Aggarwal spoke with Hindustan Times and denied writing the prescription. He added that people should not pay heed to the notice or use the medicines prescribed but consult a doctor in case of sickness. Alt News also visited the ICMR website and found no existing guideline that recommends home isolation for people showing mild symptoms of COVID-19. The latest press release is from May 30 that is about ‘ICMR advises States to conduct sero-survey to measure Coronavirus exposure in the population using IgG ELISA Test’. As of June 12, India has the fourth-highest number of COVID-19 cases. The coronavirus dashboard on Johns Hopkins University indicates India has over 3 lakh cases. While the debate on the effectiveness of the lockdown and the possible impact of unlocking the economy continues, the capacity of medical infrastructure in New Delhi seems to fall short. Issues like the shortage of hospital beds, unaffordable cost of treatment in private hospitals are frequently discussed on social media.

Coronavirus is genetically manufactured by China. It hasn’t originated from bats. Verdict All three claims are false. Fact-check 1. Tasuku Honjo never made such statements Alt News performed a keyword search on Google and found no reports which suggested Honjo said that coronavirus has a man-made origin. Had a Nobel laureate in medicine made such a statement it would have been all over the news. However, that is not the case. Moreover, on April 10, in an interview with Nikkei Asian Review , Honjo was asked — “Why have medical advances been unable to eradicate infectious diseases? ” He responded, “Medicine has evolved dramatically even compared with 20 years ago, but every new virus requires a new response. Physics and chemistry have established principles, but biology is a science that’s still developing, and there’s so much we still don’t know. So one novel virus can turn the world on its head. Many people probably wonder why, but that’s just the reality. Infectious diseases are completely different from something like cancer. Infectious diseases can spread quickly to a large number of patients.” In none of his recent interactions with the media has Honjo said that coronavirus does has a man-made origin. Honjo currently works as Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor at Institute for Advanced Study, Kyoto University. Alt News reached out to Honjo via an email. David Hajime Kornhauser, Director of Global Communications at Kyoto University, shared Honjo’s official statement in the form of the press release. The statement issued on April 27 reads, “In the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.” The full statement can be read here. 2. Tasuku Honjo has never worked in Wuhan lab for four years According to the Kyoto University Institue for Advanced Studies’ (KUIAS) website , Honjo is Deputy Director-General at the University. In 2018, Honjo and James Allison were awarded Nobel prize for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation, as per the Nobel Prize website . The KUIAS website also lists a detailed biography of Honjo starting from 1966 and it doesn’t mention that he was working at Wuhan for a period of four years. David Hajime Kornhauser shared a link to Honjo’s detailed curriculum vitae which established that he has never worked at Wuhan lab. 3. Scientists across the world agree that COVID-19 isn’t man-made A statement by public health scientists published in The Lancet says, “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.” The World Health Organisation has said that bats are the most likely ecological reservoir for the novel coronavirus, and illegally traded pangolins could be the intermediary hosts . However, a later update by the World Economic Forum states, “Originally, scientists believed the virus may have developed in bats, and later pangolins. However, genomic comparisons suggest that the SARS-Cov-2 virus is the result of a recombination between two different viruses, meaning the exact origin of the virus is still unclear.” Alt News published two reports last month — March 14 and March 28 — which debunked this claim. Conclusion A lengthy text message has gone viral on WhatsApp which claims that Japan’s Nobel Prize-winning immunologist Tasuku Honjo said that coronavirus is not natural but “manufactured by China”. Along with the text, there is a link to Honjo’s Wikipedia page. The complete message reads, “SHOCKING Japan’s professor of Physiology or Medicine, Professor Dr Tasuku Honjo, created a sensation in front of the media today by saying that the corona virus is not natural. if it is natural, it wudn’t hv adversely affected entire world like this. bcoz, as per nature, Temperature is different in different countries. if it is natural, it wud’ve adversely affected only those countries hvg same temperature as China. instead, It is spreading in a country like Switzerland, in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. whereas if it were natural, it would hv spread in cold places, but died in hot places.

It is worthwhile to note that while the claim has been published extensively by Indian media, it has found no mention in the British papers. The BBC report that was included in the Faculty of Homeopathy post shared by Manish Tewari makes no mention of Prince Charles’s homeopathy treatment. The post tagged two other pages, namely ‘British Homeopathic Association’ and ‘Homeopathy Worked for Me’ . It is possible that Tewari mistook ‘Homeopathy Worked for Me’ to be a statement made by Prince Charles. The Faculty of Homeopathy, of which the prince is the royal patron, had congratulated him on his recovery but had made no claim about his recovery being linked to any form of alternative medicine. #HRH Prince of Wales #RoyalPatron message today following his recovery after Coronavirus https://t.co/Qwi5swUo1Y we are pleased to see he is in #goodhealth #WednesdayThoughts — Faculty of Homeopathy (@fohhomeopathy) April 1, 2020 The Faculty has published a piece of advice from the UK Homeopathic community on COVID-19 which clearly states that “there are no scientific trials available for homeopathic, or any other, treatment of Coronavirus disease– COVID 19”. The advisory warns that “Homeopathic medicines have been used extensively for flu-like symptoms and in epidemics around the world. If you decide to take homeopathic medicine, this should be in addition to the various measures outlined above and should not be your only approach.” Denial by Prince Charles’s office Hindustan Times approached a spokesperson for the Prince of Wales in London to confirm whether Prince Charles’s recovery from COVID-19 was aided by advice from an Ayurveda practitioner in Bengaluru. The spokesperson told HT, “This information is incorrect. The Prince of Wales followed the medical advice of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK and nothing more.” The NHS position on Homeopathy is clear. In answer to the question, “Does Homeopathy work?”, NHS has stated on its website that, “There’s been extensive investigation of the effectiveness of homeopathy. There’s no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition”. During the course of Prince Charles’s recovery, multiple prominent media organisations reported how the Duke of Cornwall was following government guidance and medical advice. As seen above, the government guidance in the UK as illustrated on the NHS website clearly discounts homeopathy as a possible cure. In conclusion, there is no evidence to suggest that Prince Charles’s recovery had anything to do with Homeopathic or Ayurvedic medicine. The same has been denied by his office. Alt News Science had earlier debunked Ministry of AYUSH’s false propagation that homeopathic medicine ‘Arsenicum Album 30’ can prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. Our science section also carries an extensive report on the ineffectiveness of homeopathy. This can be read here . Union Minister of State for AYUSH, Shripad Naik claimed in a press briefing on April 2 that ayurvedic and homeopathic medicines helped Prince Charles, the apparent heir to the British throne, to be cured of COVID19. Naik was quoted as saying that this recovery “validates our age-old practise since thousands of years”. The source of information for the minister was a Bengaluru-based Ayurvedic doctor. In the press briefing, Naik said, “I received a phone call from Dr Isaac Mathai, who runs the Soukya Ayurveda Resort in Bengaluru. He told me that his treatment of Prince Charles through Ayurveda and Homeopathy has been successful. This is just one example of how the system can work”. Prince Charles had tested positive for coronavirus last month and has since recovered. The news was carried by news agencies and prominent media outlets in India.

I appeal to @moayush to redouble it’s efforts & incentive those Indian Institutions for eg. @SoukyaOfficial that are doing pioneering work pic.twitter.com/0Ysv16OTDR — Manish Tewari (@ManishTewari) April 1, 2020 Fact-check Prince Charles is known for his support to homeopathy and is the royal patron of the Faculty of Homeopathy (facultyofhomeopathy.org in the United Kingdom but is there any truth behind the claim that homeopathy cured him of COVID19? It is worthwhile to note that while the claim has been published extensively by Indian media, it has found no mention in the British papers. The BBC report that was included in the Faculty of Homeopathy post shared by Manish Tewari makes no mention of Prince Charles’s homeopathy treatment. The post tagged two other pages, namely ‘British Homeopathic Association’ and ‘Homeopathy Worked for Me’. It is possible that Tewari mistook ‘Homeopathy Worked for Me’ to be a statement made by Prince Charles. The Faculty of Homeopathy, of which the prince is the royal patron, had congratulated him on his recovery but had made no claim about his recovery being linked to any form of alternative medicine. #HRH Prince of Wales #RoyalPatron message today following his recovery after Coronavirus https://t.co/Qwi5swUo1Y we are pleased to see he is in #goodhealth #WednesdayThoughts — Faculty of Homeopathy (@fohhomeopathy) April 1, 2020 The Faculty has published a piece of advice from the UK Homeopathic community on COVID-19 which clearly states that “there are no scientific trials available for homeopathic, or any other, treatment of Coronavirus disease– COVID 19”. The advisory warns that “Homeopathic medicines have been used extensively for flu-like symptoms and in epidemics around the world. If you decide to take homeopathic medicine, this should be in addition to the various measures outlined above and should not be your only approach.” Denial by Prince Charles’s office Hindustan Times approached a spokesperson for the Prince of Wales in London to confirm whether Prince Charles’s recovery from COVID-19 was aided by advice from an Ayurveda practitioner in Bengaluru. The spokesperson told HT, “This information is incorrect. The Prince of Wales followed the medical advice of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK and nothing more.” The NHS position on Homeopathy is clear. In answer to the question, “Does Homeopathy work?”, NHS has stated on its website that, “There’s been extensive investigation of the effectiveness of homeopathy. There’s no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition”. During the course of Prince Charles’s recovery, multiple prominent media organisations reported how the Duke of Cornwall was following government guidance and medical advice. As seen above, the government guidance in the UK as illustrated on the NHS website clearly discounts homeopathy as a possible cure. In conclusion, there is no evidence to suggest that Prince Charles’s recovery had anything to do with Homeopathic or Ayurvedic medicine. The same has been denied by his office. Alt News Science had earlier debunked Ministry of AYUSH’s false propagation that homeopathic medicine ‘Arsenicum Album 30’ can prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. Our science section also carries an extensive report on the ineffectiveness of homeopathy. This can be read here. Note: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India is over 3,700 and more than 100 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 12 lakh confirmed cases and over 64,000 deaths have been reported. There is a sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation – misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a pandemic, can take lives.

When questioned on Twitter,...",,"When questioned on Twitter , the author, also a founder of Swarajya Magazine, cited a Nature Asia article titled, ‘More immunity in Indian genes’, as his source. The Nature Asia article (2008), based on the research study by Du and colleagues (2008) , published in the journal ‘Genes & Immunity’ was conducted by a team of scientists from the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), USA, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India (AIIMS), and National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), USA. CLAIM ‘More immunity in Indian genes’ – The title of Nature Asia magazine article. “Our bodies have one of the toughest immune systems in the world. We have grown up surrounded by so much filth and pollution that our natural resilience is much stronger than people in the developed world.” – Sandipan Deb in L ivemint. VERDICT False. FACT-CHECK 1. The Livemint article is based on a superficial understanding of the title of the Nature Asia , not its text. The Nature Asia article is titled ‘More immunity genes in Indians’. However, the article itself does not make any such claims that, on the basis of the research study quoted, that Indians will be protected from the coronavirus pandemic or other infections due to their biologically inherited ‘resilience’. It simply states that Indians may have more genes linked with immunity as per the data. Also, one of the authors of the article and the research study Rajalingam Raja wrote, “Whether having more activating KIR genes is an advantage or disadvantage for Indians remains to be elucidated.” This means that the genes tested through this study are not a piece of conclusive evidence that the contested tougher immunity will be an advantage for Indians in any way. 2. The Nature Asia article is based on a research study based on a single gene polymorphism in various ethnicities. The Nature Asia article is based on a research study which relies upon a single gene KIR2DL5 polymorphism in many ethnicities including Indian, East Asian, white (Caucasian) and black (African Americans), suggesting that the gene is not unique to Indians only. Also, no evidence suggests that the presence of gene translates to gene expression or phenotypic change (e.g. higher immunity) in this case. Nature Asia article based its claim on a gene polymorphism study by Du and colleagues (2008) . Genetic polymorphism is the occurrence of multiple forms of a single gene which is expressed in the same population as a trait or a phenotype (Bull, 2004) . It is similar, but not the same, as varying levels of pigmentation in eyes, hair or skin colour. The study quoted showed the nature of polymorphism of one gene KIR2DL5 in four ethnic groups: Caucasians (European race, mostly white), Asian-Indians (South Asians), African-Americans and Asians (East Asians, i.e. Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Filipino). KIR2DL5 (or CD158f) is the last identified KIR gene (the inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of immune cells), with KIR2DL4, it makes up a structurally divergent lineage conserved in different primate species such as humans. The percentage frequency of this KIR2DL5 gene in Indians is used as an indicator of higher immunity. The graph from the research study illustrates that the percentage frequency of KIR2DL5 (A and B, polymorphic forms of KIR2DL5 gene) is higher in Asian Indians than the other ethnic populations studied. However, the graph below from the same study suggests that the Individuals carrying the KIR2DL5 gene vary substantially among populations ranging in frequency from 35-85%. Thus, as per the author’s conclusions, higher immunity can be found in every ethnicity ranging from 35-85% population, not just in Indians. Hence, with such large variability in genes in each population, it is impossible to deduce that the researchers certainly found the KIR2DL5 gene more frequently in Indian ethnicities, as compared to other ethnicities. Also, the research paper doesn’t claim that this higher frequency in Asian-Indians population is linked to a better immune system or more natural killer cells in the body. In fact, there are no conclusions drawn on any ethnic group being genetically superior or inferior regarding immunity. 3. Is the occurrence of genes (KIR2DL5 gene) linked with immunity synonymous with its traits (tougher immunity)? The occurrence of more genes in a population isn’t always synonymous with better traits. This is mainly because a greater amount of genes doesn’t always translate to a protein abundance, which consequently becomes a trait. That is, the presence of genes doesn’t always lead to the presence of characteristic traits related to the expression of the gene. Sometimes, polymorphic changes in natural killer cells can also be associated with a susceptibility towards certain diseases (Orange, 2002) . Thus, more correlative studies should be conducted where a higher frequency of KIR2DL5 gene results in an increased immunity regardless of ethnicity. 4. Smaller sample size The beneficial effects of higher frequency of a polymorphic gene in a population can only be established after detailed protein, genomics and evolutionary studies with large sample size. But in this study, only 96 Indian genomes were studied as opposed to 250 Caucasians. Hence, these higher percent frequencies of polymorphs KIR2DL5 gene could also be an artefact resulting from a smaller sample size. Only 96 non-randomised samples for the Asian-Indian group were sourced from New Delhi, which is a minuscule representation for the Indian population. These sample sizes were further reduced after identification of KIR2DL5 positive individuals. Also, the Nature Asia article further claims that Indians gained the activating KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors) genes because of natural selection to survive the environmental challenges during their pre-historic coastal migrations from Africa. This conclusion is not based on any evidence. Similar claim in ‘The Print’ opinion piece Dr Mehra, former Dean of AIIMS, in his opinion piece in The Print mentions the results from the same study that includes SK Sharma of AIIMS, to make his claims about the genetic advantage of Indians over Caucasians with respect to immunity against the coronavirus. Additionally, Dr Mehra also included other factors that may give Indians advantage – broad-based immunity due to overexposure to other pathogens, and epigenetic factors such as environment and consumption of Indian spices in cuisine. However, since the novelty of the virus and the increasing pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in India, these claims remain without any research or evidence in Science. CONCLUSION The Nature Asia article published a misleading title on the basis of a genetics study which was termed inconclusive by the authors in their own research study. This title formed the basis of the Livemint article by Mr Deb. The Nature Asia authors generalised their misleading article about Natural Killer cells (NK) to “immunity genes”. Natural killer cells are a small component of what makes up human immunity, not the expansive immune system. Later, in the Livemint article, the Nature Asia article was used to claim a blanket superiority of the immune system of Indians. Mr Deb stated that Indians’ immune system is more robust than the people in the developed world to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Such dangerous opinion pieces with no understanding of the genetics of immunity have the potential to drive people to be careless with the protocols issued by the government on social distancing and other precautions or to encourage reckless behaviour during a critical situation.

Right-wing website OpIndia included the series in an article on ‘coronavirus predictions’. The English translation of the dialogues is as follows: Doctor: “We must do more research, but it looks like a mutant coronavirus.” Agent: “Corona? Then MERS?” Doctor: “MERS, SARS, the common flu. They all fall in the same gene family with the same gene information. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system. During the 2015 MERS epidemic, the mortality rate was over 20 percent.” Agent: “But that’s not serious enough to be used as a weapon. Am I wrong?” Doctor: “Like I said, this is a mutant virus. Someone tweaked it to increase the mortality rate to almost 90 percent. What’s more serious is that the coronavirus has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. This virus was mutated to attack the lungs directly within five minutes of being exposed. ” CLAIM: In their conversation, the actors give the following details about the coronavirus. 1. Man-made mutant virus. 2. Mortality rate of 90%. 3. Attacks the lungs within 5 minutes of exposure. Social media users have used the conversation to claim that the show predicted the COVID-19 pandemic. VERDICT: False. FACT-CHECK: ‘My Secret, Terrius’ original title ‘Nae Dwie Teriuseu’ is a science-fiction drama series released in 2018 where a National Intelligence Service (NIS) agent helps a woman track her husband who gets involved in a conspiracy. To suggest that a fictional series ‘predicted’ the future in itself is preposterous. However, in the course of this fact-check, we will show that the ‘mutant coronavirus’ spoken about in the series is not similar to the novel coronavirus. 1. A. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is not man-made. Bogus claims about nCoV being engineered as a biological weapon have already been debunked by multiple platforms both national and international . A statement by public health scientists published in The Lancet says, “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.” As per a World Health Organisation (WHO) situation report from February 21, “The most likely ecological reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are bats, but it is believed that the virus jumped the species barrier to humans from another intermediate animal host. This intermediate animal host could be a domestic food animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal which has not yet been identified. ” Another WHO situation report says, “There’s one paper that mentions the pangolin and that there’s some close association with the COVID-19 virus and that could be the intermediary host but that’s not the full story so there’s a lot of area of work that needs to be conducted to really identify the intermediate hosts…” Scientists in China are also researching if illegally traded pangolins were the intermediate host. 1. B. The novel coronavirus is a new strain in the coronavirus family. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, “Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. In fact, there are many coronaviruses that infect different animals. Of those, from the mid-1960s till date, seven coronaviruses have been shown to infect humans. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) and its outbreak COVID-19 has not been previously identified in humans. The most recent outbreak of varied forms of the virus, apart from the recent COVID-19 pandemic, is SARS-CoV or Severe Acute respiratory syndrome which was identified in 2002 in China and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In the viral episode, the doctor makes a reference to both MERS and SARS. This in itself hints that the plot is inspired by previous coronavirus outbreaks and has nothing to do with COVID-19. 2. The estimated mortality of nCoV is 3-4%. As per a WHO situation report from March 6 , “While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower.” However, mortality rate depends on varied factors such as the quality of healthcare, the steps taken by particular countries to prevent the spread of the infection, the demographics of a region. Based on the data available on John Hopkins University and Medicine , the fatality rate in Italy is slightly above 10 percent. In contrast, the death rate in China, where the viral infection first emerged, is about 4 percent. The large number of deaths in Italy, despite near-draconian restrictions imposed on citizen movements, are linked to the country’s aged population. Furthermore, the numbers may not be in perfect correlation to the infected population as many countries are focusing more on testing patients with severe symptoms or travel history. Those with mild symptoms are either not tested or advised home quarantine. The fatality rate in South Korea is among the lowest – 1.4 percent – despite the government not imposing a complete lockdown. “As of March 15, Italy had carried out about 125,000 tests. In contrast, South Korea – which implemented a strategy of widespread testing – has conducted some 340,000 tests, including for those showing mild or no symptoms at all,” reports Al Jazeera . Therefore, the mortality rate also depends on pro-active measures taken by countries. No scientific or media reports put the death rate at 90 percent, which is the death rate of the mutant coronavirus in the Korean drama. 3. The novel coronavirus has an incubation period of 2-14 days. In the series, the mutant CoV attacks the lungs within five minutes of exposure. The WHO Q&A on coronavirus says, “The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.” The coronavirus research centre of the Harvard Medical School also gives a similar incubation period – 3 to 13 days. “Recently published research found that on average, the incubation period is about five days.” Therefore, the claim that Korean drama series ‘My secret, Terrius’ predicted the COVID-19 outbreak is bogus, to say the least. The ‘mutant coronavirus’ featured in the series is not similar to the novel coronavirus. Social media users baffled across the globe are sharing a scene from the Korean web series ‘My Secret, Terrius’ suggesting that the 10th episode of the series predicted the novel coronavirus pandemic. Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh and actor Meera Chopra were among those who shared the clip. This is crazy . If you are home , go on Netflix now ……. Type “My Secret Terrius” and go to season -1 and episode 10 and move straight to 53 minutes point ! (P.S. this season was made in 2018 and we are in 2020) . This is shocking 😡😡😡 was it a plan ?? pic.twitter.com/KqTZwA1IO2 — Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) March 26, 2020 BJP Delhi IT cell head Punit Agarwal also tweeted the scene and wrote that the show talks about a “biological weapon called coronavirus”. In 2018 show named “My Secret Terrius” Season 10 talks about a biological weapon called Corona Virus. #ChineseVirus pic.twitter.com/0uiugAo6om — Punit Agarwal (@Punitspeaks) March 26, 2020 The episode in question can be watched below with English subtitles. In the drama My Secret Terrius that was released in 2018 (UNIQ’s sungjoo was among the cast) they talked in details about the corona virus…. I had goosebumps… pic.twitter.com/nuQ3UYZlMR — 🦄 (@eoeoes) March 18, 2020 The so-called prediction was also reported by media outlets –The Indian Express, OneIndia, The Hindu, The Quint, PTI, India Today, Navbharat Times, Dainik Jagran, Aaj Tak, and Live Hindustan among others. Right-wing website OpIndia included the series in an article on ‘coronavirus predictions’. The English translation of the dialogues is as follows: Doctor: “We must do more research, but it looks like a mutant coronavirus.” Agent: “Corona? Then MERS?” Doctor: “MERS, SARS, the common flu. They all fall in the same gene family with the same gene information. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system. During the 2015 MERS epidemic, the mortality rate was over 20 percent.” Agent: “But that’s not serious enough to be used as a weapon. Am I wrong?” Doctor: “Like I said, this is a mutant virus. Someone tweaked it to increase the mortality rate to almost 90 percent. What’s more serious is that the coronavirus has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. This virus was mutated to attack the lungs directly within five minutes of being exposed. ” CLAIM: In their conversation, the actors give the following details about the coronavirus. 1. Man-made mutant virus. 2. Mortality rate of 90%. 3. Attacks the lungs within 5 minutes of exposure. Social media users have used the conversation to claim that the show predicted the COVID-19 pandemic. VERDICT: False. FACT-CHECK: ‘My Secret, Terrius’ original title ‘Nae Dwie Teriuseu’ is a science-fiction drama series released in 2018 where a National Intelligence Service (NIS) agent helps a woman track her husband who gets involved in a conspiracy. To suggest that a fictional series ‘predicted’ the future in itself is preposterous. However, in the course of this fact-check, we will show that the ‘mutant coronavirus’ spoken about in the series is not similar to the novel coronavirus. 1. A. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is not man-made. Bogus claims about nCoV being engineered as a biological weapon have already been debunked by multiple platforms both national and international. A statement by public health scientists published in The Lancet says, “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.” As per a World Health Organisation (WHO) situation report from February 21, “The most likely ecological reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are bats, but it is believed that the virus jumped the species barrier to humans from another intermediate animal host. This intermediate animal host could be a domestic food animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal which has not yet been identified. ” Another WHO situation report says, “There’s one paper that mentions the pangolin and that there’s some close association with the COVID-19 virus and that could be the intermediary host but that’s not the full story so there’s a lot of area of work that needs to be conducted to really identify the intermediate hosts…” Scientists in China are also researching if illegally traded pangolins were the intermediate host. 1. B. The novel coronavirus is a new strain in the coronavirus family. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, “Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. In fact, there are many coronaviruses that infect different animals. Of those, from the mid-1960s till date, seven coronaviruses have been shown to infect humans. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) and its outbreak COVID-19 has not been previously identified in humans. The most recent outbreak of varied forms of the virus, apart from the recent COVID-19 pandemic, is SARS-CoV or Severe Acute respiratory syndrome which was identified in 2002 in China and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

The ‘mutant coronavirus’ featured in the series is not similar to the novel coronavirus. Note: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India is over 900. This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 6 lakh confirmed cases and close to 27,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation – misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a global pandemic, can take lives.

The novel coronavirus (nCoV) or COVID-19 is not a new disease. 2. The treatment for the disease has already been found. 3. Coronavirus can be cured with aspirin, antihistamines and nasal spray. VERDICT: False FACT-CHECK: All three claims raised on social media are false. 1. The novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of coronavirus. The novel coronavirus is a new strain of the coronavirus family. It has unique characteristics and has never been discovered before. “This #coronavirus is not SARS, it’s not MERS & it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics. Both #COVID19 & influenza cause respiratory disease & spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose & mouth of someone who is sick”- @DrTedros — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 3, 2020 Chinese health authorities say that nCoV is likely to have come from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was also traded illegally. Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from “an infected animal species to humans through illegally-trafficked pangolins”, which are prized in Asia for food and medicine. “Scientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as the source of the virus,” adds the report. The novel coronavirus is a new variety of coronavirus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, “Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.” A novel coronavirus (nCoV) and its outbreak COVID-19 has not been previously identified in humans. Its symptoms include fever, tiredness and dry cough. In most severe cases it causes shortness of breath, aches and pains, sore throat or in rare cases – diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. “Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.” SARS-CoV is Severe Acute respiratory syndrome which was identified in 2002. It is thought to be an animal virus from an “as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002,” per WHO. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Therefore, while different strains of coronavirus have been discovered before, the novel coronavirus also knows as nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 is new. 2. There is no cure for novel coronavirus yet. “There is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019,” states WHO. In fact, no vaccine has yet been found even for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It usually takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new vaccine however, technological advancement has sped up the process. Recently, US president Donald Trump touted Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as possible treatments for coronavirus following which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clinical trials of Chloroquine . However, an Arizona man with nCoV died in an apparent attempt to self-medicate with Chloroquine. His wife is in critical condition. According to a Forbes Tracker, several drug companies, universities and biotech start-ups are researching treatment and cures for the disease. All medications are either in early stages of development or animal and human testing. 3. Coronavirus cannot be ‘cured’ with aspirin, antihistamines and nasal spray. When any of the coronaviruses (or rhinoviruses for that matter) cause the common cold, the physicians’ aim is to (a) stop the transmission of the infection to other people and (b) treat the symptoms. This is because the common cold is a self-limited disease – it cures by itself. It is for this reason, antivirals or antibiotics are not given for a common cold. In the usual clinical picture, it is also not required to find out which organism has caused the common cold since it has no bearing on its treatment. The mainstay of symptomatic treatment for the common cold is anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs (aspirin is one of them), antihistamines, anticholinergic drugs and decongestants (which can be given as nasal spray). All of these can be bought at pharmaceutical stores without a doctor’s prescription. However, when coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cause severe disease with manifestations like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, the treatment involves intensive care and not over-the-counter medications. Therefore, it is inappropriate to extrapolate the treatment for the common cold as the treatment of all coronavirus infections. The textbook itself mentions inexact and inappropriate treatment. “Nasal spray” only implies the route through which the medicine is given – through the nose. There are many drugs given through the nasal route, decongestants for the common cold are only one of them. CONCLUSION Thus an excerpt from a zoology textbook covering the basics of the common cold was taken out of context. The claims made rest on the misconception that there is only one coronavirus and that coronavirus only causes the common cold. In fact, there are many coronaviruses that infect different animals. Of those, from the mid-1960s till date, seven coronaviruses have been shown to infect humans including SARS, MERS and the novel COVID-19. These viruses cause a wide range of illnesses from common cold to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Hence these viral tweets are misleading people on the treatment available for coronavirus and fuel conspiracy theories that the current coronavirus pandemic is not new.

This has caused the government to impose a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services. Globally, more than 4 lakh confirmed cases and over 19,000 deaths have been reported. There is a growing sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation – misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments. While your intentions may be pure, misinformation, spread especially during a global pandemic, can take lives.

According to the about-us section, Sugentech, a Republic of Korea-based manufacturer, “develops in-vitro diagnostic systems and products based on BT-IT-NT convergence technology.” SD Biosensor is another Republic of Korea-based company which manufactures test kits for “qualitative presumptive detection of specific IgM and IgG to 2019 novel coronavirus”. A message circulating on WhatsApp claims that US scientists have developed a vaccine for coronavirus. It claims that President Donald Trump has announced that “Roche Medical Company” will launch the vaccine this sunday. “Great news! Carona virus vaccine ready. Able to cure patient within 3 hours after injection. Hats off to US Scientists.

This text is viral in English , Hindi and Telugu along with the hashtag #JantaCurfew. The viral message has been shared on Twitter , Facebook and WhatsApp. VERDICT False FACTS Virus can survive on surfaces for upto 3 days. Infected individuals can infect others for upto two weeks. FACT-CHECK A viral infection can be transmitted from one individual to another in multiple ways. 1) Direct: From one individual to another individual either via means of touch, or if the infected individual coughs or sneezes in close vicinity of another person. 2) Indirect: When an infected individual touches a surface, and another individual touches the same surface. In the course of this article, we will demonstrate that a 14-hour self-imposed curfew will not break the cycle of infection as the coronavirus persists 2-3 days later on surfaces. However, social lockdown is an effective strategy for reducing new infections that flattens the curve. The novel CoV infection has a high incubation rate. The scientists at Imperial College, UK estimate that each coronavirus patient infects on average 2.6 others, making it almost as infectious as yearly influenza outbreaks. While the common influenza virus has a short incubation period and is self-resolving, the 2019-nCoV can be incubated for up to two weeks, hence increasing its chances to infect other people. So, someone who is infected with CoV would be able to pass it on to someone else till upto two weeks, even if the former isn’t yet displaying any symptoms. Alt News Science recently published an elaborate fact-check regarding how long can coronavirus live on various surfaces. Research (Doremalen et al 2020) published in the New England Journal of Medicine conducted by American scientists ( preprint here ) suggests that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces for as long as 2-3 days. They tested the virus by spraying into the air by a nebuliser mimicking the coughing action of an infected person. They found that it could be detected up to a minimum of 3 hours later in the air, up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces. The longevity of the virus was determined by studying the decay time or half-life of the virus, which is the time it takes for it to reduce in 50% tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) per litre of air. It was determined that the virus stayed on cardboard, stainless steel and plastic for the longest period, in comparison to copper and aerosol droplets. On average, the half-life of the virus on plastic surface was the highest, with an average of 15.9 hours (high 19.2 hours), copper was lower 3.4 hours (high 5.11 hours), and stainless steel was 13.1 hours (high 16.1 hours). No research was conducted on fabric at all. The study also suggests that the virus can spread through the air, from touching things that were contaminated by those who are infected, and through direct human contact. The virus was formerly known as HCoV-19, but is referred to as SARS-CoV2 in this study as the comparison of longevity was in comparison with the virus found in the previous coronavirus outbreaks, known as SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV1 in the study quoted above. CONCLUSION Thus, an individual infected with coronavirus can pass on the infection to another person for upto 14 days. Also, the coronavirus could be detected up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces. The results from this study indicate that the coronavirus can be transmitted through aerosols (clusters of the virus in the air) aerosol and fomites (objects such as plastic, steel, other metals contaminated with the virus) are plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. Hence, a 14 hour self-imposed curfew cannot break the cycle of infection as it is being claimed on social media. Despite the fact that the curfew will not break the cycle of infection as the Coronavirus still persists 2-3 days later on surfaces, the social lockdown is an effective strategy for reducing new infections that ‘flattens the curve’ On March 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a 29-minute address to take precautionary measures including observing a ‘Janta Curfew’ on March 22 from 7 AM to 9 PM to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in India. Since then, several social media users have posted a text claiming that the coronavirus has a life cycle of 12 hours and a 14-hour curfew will help to break the chain and curb the further spread of the virus.

This research estimated the decay rates of the coronavirus on surfaces using a Bayesian regression model ( Methods linked here )- where the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable (surface) is elucidated using the Bayes’ theorem – a hypothesis based on prior knowledge and updates as more information is available. CONCLUSION Thus, the coronavirus could be detected up to a minimum of 3 hours later in the air, up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces. The results from this study indicate that the coronavirus can be transmitted through aerosols (clusters of the virus in the air) aerosol and fomites (objects such as plastic, steel, other metals contaminated with the virus) are plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. No information was given on fabric in this study, but it is likely that the fabric remains contaminated hours after the exposure similar to cardboard. Furthermore, no study has been conducted that suggests sun exposure as a factor that reduces the virus. Finally, the inability to detect the virus (under the detection threshold) is not equivalent to the complete elimination of the virus. However, to acquire an infection, one needs a minimum threshold or level or viral exposure. Hence, the claim on the longevity of 12 hrs is false. The virus remains intact on the surface for much longer. Several messages circulating on social media have made claims regarding the lifespan of the coronavirus outside the human body. CLAIM 1.

It claims that all chilling stations of the company will be closed for an indefinite time from March 21, 2020. “विषय : कोरोना वायरस की बजह से चिलिंग सेंटर बंद करने के सम्बन्ध (Subject: Regarding the closure of chilling stations due to coronavirus)” – reads the subject line of the notice. Posted by Mohammed Mohsin Ansari on Thursday, 19 March 2020 Several Facebook users have shared the alleged notice. Posted by Anil Swami on Wednesday, 18 March 2020 Fake notice Alt News could neither locate any such information on the Amul website or news reports alerting that the company has decided to suspend business due to coronavirus. The managing director of the cooperative body Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) RS Sodhi took to Twitter and informed that the notice is fake. Amul is managed by GCMMF. “None of our milk chilling centre or procurement activities are going to close down. Rather we are procuring more,” wrote Sodhi. It seems somebody spreading this news which is fake and none of our milk chilling centre or procurement activities are going to close down , Rather we are procuring more .@atul1chaturvedi @girirajsinghbjp pic.twitter.com/Glgl8rxfDj — R S Sodhi (@Rssamul) March 18, 2020 A Financial Express article quotes Sodhi saying that milk supply will not be disrupted due to the spread of COVID-19. “According to Sodhi there has been sizable shift of demand for milk from retail outlets to e-commerce platforms and Amul kiosk because of coronavirus scare,” reads the report. Speaking with Zee News, he also said that people are indulging in panic buys and hoarding of supplies in cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore due to which the sales of milk power, ghee, butter, etc has shot up. However, “this is not creating any problem related to supply at our end as we keep an inventory of 15-20 days in advance. This has helped us in increasing our production. Thus there is no such shortage,” he continued. A fake notice is therefore viral in the name of Amul, claiming that the company will shut down its chilling centres from March 21.",Pooja Chaudhuri,False,False,1

Avoid Mutton in all forms.👇 Just an awareness video, have not checked the credibility of this video🙏🏻 Posted by Amarveer Dhillon on Sunday, 23 February 2020 Several users are advising against the consumption of mutton. Another deadly unknown virus is spreading in mutton livestock market in India, so avoid consuming goat mutton. Pass the video on. Posted by naomithebossblogspot.ie on Friday, 13 March 2020 Alt News has received multiple fact-check requests for the video on its mobile application. FACT-CHECK The earliest instance of the video on the internet that Alt News could trace was uploaded on YouTube on December 12, 2019. The first coronavirus case was detected in Kerala on January 30, 2020. Alt News spoke with the Additional Director (Farms and Estate), Rajasthan Animal Husbandry Department, Dr Pradeep Saraswat, who informed that his office has come across the video. “This video was also shared with us by the Government of India. Even though I was aware that it’s fake and old, I conducted an investigation. It is fake and no viral infection in goats has been reported in the area. I have also replied to the GOI, Joint Secretary.” The department’s Joint Director (Animal Disease Control), Dr Tej Singh, gave a similar statement and called the viral claims “fake news”. Gajanand Khatik, a trader at Ajmer bakra market, said, “This is just an attempt to build a narrative against the consumption of meat. No virus is spreading here. If that were the case, health department officials would have conducted inspections. They [the people spreading rumours] are only trying to hamper our business. Why would we sell contaminated meat and dupe people? The rumours are just spreading due to the coronavirus scare.” It is noteworthy that all three men claimed that the video was not shot in the Ajmer bakra market. However, Alt News has not verified the same. A quick search for media reports echoing social media assertions does not yield results. An old video is therefore circulating on social media that goats in Ajmer’s bakra market are either infected with COVID-19 or an unknown virus that is making them sick. Can COVID-19 infect goats? Alt News Science editor Dr Sumaiya Shaikh informs that it’s possible that animals domesticated for consumption or dairy can be infected with the coronavirus. “Previous scientific research (Haitham Mohamed Amer, Cambridge University Press, 2019) has shown that domestic as well as wild animals including goats have been infected in the earlier coronavirus epidemics.” However, continues Dr Shaikh, “Infection in animals such as goats requires a different strain of the same virus than the one which infects humans. Since it has not been found that goats were infected in Ajmer due to the coronavirus, it is likely that the video is false.” Earlier a piece of false news was viral that broiler chicken was found to be infected with COVID-19.

Message from partly fictitious persons viral Zanjan University is not located in China but in Iran . Leila Ahmadi is an author of a research paper from Zanjan University, Iran, in the area of reproductive health, rather than infectious diseases. There is also no reason to believe that Ahmadi is indeed the author of the message attributed to her. We could neither find her social media profile where the message might have been shared or any media reports featuring the same. Her research gate profile describes her as an instructor of Reproductive Health, Department of Midwifery and has not detailed any other skills. Professor Chen Horin is a fictitious character claimed to be from the Beijing Military hospital. He seemingly suggests that lemon has anti-cancer properties. Alt News Science found that the image used in the Facebook post is of a real person named Professor Frank Chen Youhua , a Professor of Management Sciences, City University of Hong Kong. Also, the YouTube video linked in the Facebook post is of a different ‘Chen’ from the photo in the Facebook post. The one from the YouTube video is an American researcher from the ‘National Cancer Institute, and his real identity is Dr Li-Chuan-Chen, Phd. Thus, both identities Laila Ahmadi and Chen Horin are partly fictitious and our research suggests that the real ‘Ahmadi’ and ‘Chen’ do not have the expertise to make such claims. 2. The novel coronavirus is not the result of a gene fusion between a snake and a bat. Viruses are not made by gene fusion of two animals. As far as the origins of COVID-19 is concerned, it is likely that the infected bats and/or pangolins from the wet livestock market of Wuhan are the original source of the virus. 3. HIV virus does not spread by direct contact with the infected. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) transmits mainly via respiratory droplets that people sneeze, cough, or exhale, in addition to touching contaminated surfaces or people and subsequently touch the face. HIV does not spread by touching. It can spread by unprotected sex, transfusion of blood contaminated with HIV and from a mother to the child during gestation and delivery. 4. No evidence that using a large amount of Vitamin C gets rid of the novel coronavirus. Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant which protects the body against oxidative challenges. A review analysis (Carr & Maggini, 2017) suggests that for the prophylactic prevention of infection, the human body requires a dietary dose of vitamin C levels between 100-200 mg/day. However, another review (Biancatelli, 2020) argues that there are limited evidence-based clinical trials to conclusively support this contention. Vitamin C infusion is currently being tried for treatment of Severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia in a randomized clinical trial registered by Professor Zhi-Yong Peng Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China (identifier number NCT04264533 at ClinicalTrials.gov ). However, the results are pending. 5. Lemon cannot cure all cancers or regulate high blood pressure, protect narrow arteries, regulate blood circulation and reduce blood clotting. The claim that hot lemon cures cancer is an old piece of misinformation that resurfaces from time to time. It has been adequately debunked by Africa Check in 2019, David Mikkelson at Snopes in 2011, and Brett M. Christensen at Hoax Slayer in 2018. There is no catch-all cure for cancer as it is a single name for many diseases. Cancer can arise from many causes including gene mutations at random, mutations caused by external agents such as radiation and smoking, infections such as papilloma wart virus that causes cervical cancer, and also genetics such as the inheritable BRCA1 gene responsible for breast cancer. There is no evidence that Vitamin C has any therapeutic role in the regulation of blood pressure and blood clotting. 6. There is currently no vaccine and treatment for the novel coronavirus. Currently, antivirals such as Remdesivir (developed by Gilead Sciences) are being tried on confirmed COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir, an investigative antiviral , hasn’t shown any conclusive efficacy in coronavirus infections, however, the drug was used previously during the Ebola epidemic in humans, and in animal models of MERS and SARS infections. Antivirals are a class of drugs which act against viruses and can only be prescribed by healthcare providers, which are distinct from antibiotics used for bacterial infections. Kaletra is an anti-HIV drug (a combination of protease inhibitors- lopinavir and ritonavir) which has been reported in the successful treatment of some COVID-19 cases in Australia . A similar treatment for the viral infection using some unspecified anti-HIV drugs has also been reported in Rajasthan . There are no vaccines approved for coronavirus therapy. A vaccine made out of mRNA called BNT162 developed by Germany’s BioNTech will start trials in late April as per media reports . There is another mRNA vaccine called mRNA-1273 manufactured by Moderna (member of BioNTech) and has begun trials in Seattle . However, the treatment and vaccine are just starting out for testing. It is not clear whether the patients will respond effectively or have any changes of curing, nor do we know that the vaccine will provide rigorous immunity against the infection. Currently, symptomatic treatment has been given for reducing fever, cough and dehydration. CONCLUSION This viral message is a combination of an old post about lemons attributed to Professor Chen and a new piece of misinformation attributed to Laila Ahmadi. All characters were found to be fictitious, while the real names, images and videos attributed to Ahmadi and Chen were found to be of people from different unrelated places, without any expertise to comment on the subject. It is also very dangerous to circulate that certain components of a normal diet can be consumed in excess. Taking high doses of Vitamin C can cause renal stones, nausea, vomiting, occult rectal bleeding, dental decalcification and rebound scurvy in infants born to women taking high doses. Claims of cancer panacea are also dangerous as they keep the patients from seeking actual medical care. The viral message stigmatises HIV-positive people as untouchables and perpetuates the taboo that makes life much harder for them. Viral texts that advocate reliance on unproven treatments, and quotes from seemingly real experts, have the propensity to drive people away from modern medical care, precautions and practices that actually work.

It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021 , which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch . However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed on a black stone is viral on social media. It is claimed that this stone was found in Afghanistan. Viral messages claim that though the stone is cool from the outside, it can melt anything made of steel and iron when placed in contact.

It shows nine cities highlighted in Chinese text. Along with the viral image, users have claimed, “Strange eerie...",Cities worst affected by coronavirus cases are along latitude 40°,"On March 12, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson and managing director of Biocon, tweeted the viral image ( archive link) . She also added in her tweet that “southern hemisphere seems to be unaffected” from the coronavirus so far. Several users have shared the on Twitter and Facebook . Alt News has received several requests to fact-check the images on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application . Claim is ridiculous The viral claim lists four cities – Wuhan, Seattle, Washington and New York along with five countries – France, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan while claiming that “all worst affected coronavirus [Covid 19] cases are along the same Latitude 40°.” It is important to keep in mind that, as per the US Geological Survey , at 38 degrees north latitude one degree of latitude is around 69 miles (111 kilometres). Therefore, large countries cannot be represented by a single latitude. Alt News identified the most severely affected cities in the countries mentioned in the viral message using data from respective government websites. As of March 13, data from Santé publique France , national public health agency, revealed that the Grand Est. an administrative region in northeastern France, had the highest number of cases reported. Similarly, Bergamo, a city in the Lombardy region, is the worst affected as per Ministero della salute , Italy’s Ministry of Health. On the same date, an infographic published by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) , the official news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, illustrated the national capital Tehran as the most severely affected. A March 12 report by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that Daegu Metropolitan City, the third-largest after Seoul, and Busan is the worst affected region. Nippo , a Japan-based media platform reported that Hokkaidō was reported most numbers confirmed virus carriers as of March 12. Nippo’s report was created based on data by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare .

The 12 most affected countries as of March 16 doesn’t include Japan, which is one of the places shown on the viral map image. While it is true that countries listed above are from the northern hemisphere, Shaw’s statement that “southern hemisphere seems to be unaffected” is false. The screenshot from CNA’s interactive maps shows some of the countries affected in the southern hemisphere. Data for each country can be viewed by zooming in in the interactive map . Therefore the claim that the cities worst affected by coronavirus cases are along latitude 40° is false. If you would like to learn how GPS coordinates work, watch this explainer video by Brainstuff . A two-dimensional image of the globe has gone viral on social media. It shows nine cities highlighted in Chinese text. Along with the viral image, users have claimed, “Strange eerie coincidence that all worst affected Corona Virus [Covid 19] cases are along the same Latitude 40° from left: France, Italy, Iran, Wuhan, South Korea, Japan, Seattle, Washington, NewYork… Isn’t it quite ridiculous & mind-boggling?” On March 12, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson and managing director of Biocon, tweeted the viral image (archive link). She also added in her tweet that “southern hemisphere seems to be unaffected” from the coronavirus so far. Several users have shared the on Twitter and Facebook. Alt News has received several requests to fact-check the images on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application. Claim is ridiculous The viral claim lists four cities – Wuhan, Seattle, Washington and New York along with five countries – France, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan while claiming that “all worst affected coronavirus [Covid 19] cases are along the same Latitude 40°.” It is important to keep in mind that, as per the US Geological Survey, at 38 degrees north latitude one degree of latitude is around 69 miles (111 kilometres). Therefore, large countries cannot be represented by a single latitude. Most affected cities in the above-listed countries. Alt News identified the most severely affected cities in the countries mentioned in the viral message using data from respective government websites. As of March 13, data from Santé publique France, national public health agency, revealed that the Grand Est. an administrative region in northeastern France, had the highest number of cases reported. Similarly, Bergamo, a city in the Lombardy region, is the worst affected as per Ministero della salute, Italy’s Ministry of Health. On the same date, an infographic published by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), the official news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, illustrated the national capital Tehran as the most severely affected.

Water alone cannot break this outer layer structural links or bonds which is made of the fatty layers (lipids). However, regular soap being an amphiphile- a substance which has both water-loving (hydrophilic) and fat-loving (lipophilic) molecules, binds to the fatty layer of the virus and detaches the fatty layer which disassembles the virus structure, thereby killing the virus.

Below is a tweet in Indonesian.

A Hindi text claims that a book in China predicted that the country developed the coronavirus to eradicate poverty. “चीन में ये किताब पहले ही आ गई थी जिसमे कहा गया था कोरॉना चीन में सरकार गरीबी हटाने के लिए इस वायरस का उपयोग करेगी चीनी सरकार ऐसा वॉट्सएप पर कहा जा रहा है,” reads the complete message. FACT-CHECK The novel describes ‘Wuhan-400’ as follows: 1. Developed by a Chinese scientist in an RDNA laboratory outside the city of Wuhan. 2. Wuhan-400 affects only human beings. No other living creature can carry it. 3. The weapon can’t survive outside a living human body for more than a minute. The available information about COVID-19 suggests that these predictions are not aligned with the recent outbreak. Coronavirus is not man-made. Animals can also host the virus. Bogus claims about CoV being engineered as a biological weapon has already been debunked by multiple platforms both national and international . A statement by public health scientists published in The Lancet says , “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.” According to an Al Jazeera report, “Chinese health authorities are still trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say likely came from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was also traded illegally.” This also debunks the second prediction that the novel coronavirus only lives in humans. The report adds that Chinese researchers said the virus could have spread from “an infected animal species to humans through illegally-trafficked pangolins”, which are prized in Asia for food and medicine. “Scientists have pointed to either bats or snakes as the source of the virus.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) states, “Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such a MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.” A novel coronavirus (nCoV) and its outbreak COVID-19 has not been previously identified in humans. “Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans,” the WHO adds. Scientific study suggests that the novel coronavirus can survive outside the human body for hours, or even days. An earlier fact-check by Alt News Science editor Dr Sumaiya Shaikh and pharmacovigilance physician Dr Sharfaroz cited a new-preprint study (Doremalen et al 2020) conducted by American scientists. According to the study, COVID-19 can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces for as long as 2-3 days. The study also suggests that the virus can spread through the air as well as from touching things that were contaminated by those who are infected as well as through direct human contact. They tested the virus by spraying into the air by a nebuliser mimicking the coughing action of an infected person. They learnt that could be detected up to 3 hours later in the air, up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces. 1981 EDITION OF KOONTZ’S NOVEL HAS NO REFERENCES TO WUHAN A search inside the 1981 edition of ‘The Eyes of Darkness’ on Google books reveals that the fictional novel termed the biological weapon ‘Gorki-400’. According to an article in South China Morning Post, Koontz had the virus originating in Russia. “The book appears to have been rewritten after the collapse of the Soviet Union meant the country was no longer seen as a communist bogeyman,” says the article which adds that the first edition of the book was written under Koontz’s pseudonym Leigh Nichols. The 1981 version on Google books also recognises the author as Leigh Nicols. The initial copy concerns a virus called Gorki-400 that was created by the Russians and emerged from “the city of Gorki”. South China Morning Post also provided an excerpt from the first edition where Gorki-400 and Russia are featured. “The change to Wuhan came when the book was released in hardback under Koontz’s own name in 1989. The year of the book’s re-release is significant – 1989 marked the end of the Cold War. And with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country was no longer communist…An American author pointing the fictional finger of blame at Russia would not have gone down well in that climate, so The Eyes of Darkness needed a new villain,” continues the article. “Is Coranavirus a biological Weapon developed by the Chinese called Wuhan -400?

Their major constituents are genetic material such as RNA. Therefore, the details about the cell size in the viral text stand invalid. Coronaviruses are ~125 nm in size (Fehr & Perlman, 2015) , where one nanometre (nm) is 1/1000 of a micrometre (μm). [READ: WHO guidelines on when and how to use masks.] Despite that, they are one of the largest known RNA viruses (Sexton et al. 2016) , still smaller than bacteria and human cells. The figure below (adapted from Lumen, microbiology ) gives a visual representation of the virus size in comparison with atoms, proteins and lipid molecules and bacteria, plant and animal cells. Thus, coronavirus can penetrate through masks through tiny viral clusters as well as through the eyes. However, masks on an infected person can prevent water droplets with coronavirus from dispersing into the air. This air transmission is the main method through which the coronavirus or other viruses infecting the respiratory tracts are transmitted. However, The Time magazine reported from David Hui , a respiratory medicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studied the 2002 to 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) extensively, says it’s “common sense” that wearing a mask would protect against infectious diseases like COVID-19 if “you are standing in front of someone who is sick”. Also, patients with COVID-19 often have mild symptoms or a complete lack of symptoms but may be contagious to other people unknowingly. Thus masks can be an effective strategy in enclosed areas to prevent the spread of infections to other people. CONCLUSION Hence, the virus size itself is small enough to penetrate the pores of a fabric mask. Since the virus may get transmitted via aerosols (clusters of the virus in the air droplets) if an infectious person coughs or sneezes, the clusters can be caught in a mask. Thus infected people wearing masks is an effective way to prevent the spread. However, since the infection can be asymptomatic in some individuals, it is better to use masks in enclosed or public places, specifically with older people as they get severely affected by the infection. Although, thee virus can also be transmitted through eyes as air droplets are the main mode of virus transmission. In case of any symptoms such as dry cough, fever, sore throat and breathing difficulties, it’s imperative that the individual self isolates and seek medical attention.

It informed, “A fake O.M. from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has been doing the rounds today. The fake O.M. is regarding the subject “Clarification regarding declaration of holidays for the States” and is dated March 13, 2020. It is clarified that the above mentioned O.M is fake and has NOT BEEN issued by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Necessary action under extant law is being initiated.” Several users have shared a PDF file or its screenshot which appears to be a notice from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India. The subject line states it is a ‘clarification regarding the declaration of holidays for the states – Maharasthra, Gujrat, Uttar Pradesh and Sikkim.’ It further states – Experts across the world have advised reducing mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus disease. In view of the above, it is advised that mass gathering may be avoided or possibly be postponed until the disease spread is contained. As a step towards containing the disease Ministry of Health & Family Welfare declares holiday from the period of 14th March 2020 to 21st March 2020. This holiday is mandatory to all schools, colleges, educational institutes, workplace having more than 10 employees present in at a time, all the statutory & local bodies of the state. In case of any breach of the order a fine of Rs. 5000/-will applicable per day. Alt News has received several requests to fact-check this image on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.

Please take care of yourself and your family. #UNICEF #CoronavirusOutbreak pic.twitter.com/hvTCZ0w4uf — Robert Vadra (@irobertvadra) March 5, 2020 Infographics on coronavirus are also circulating on messaging applications with the claim that they have been released by UNICEF. Alt News has received several fact-check requests on our mobile app. Fact-check UNICEF did not release this advisory. Alka Gupta, the communications specialist, UNICEF India, confirmed by emailing Alt News Science that the viral text was not from the UN body. Furthermore, she added that it is “dangerous (to) advice on how drinking hot water, exposure to the sun and avoiding cold food can help ‘prevent’ being infected with COVID-19”. This report will fact-check the claims made in the viral advisory one by one. 1. The claim that the COVID-19 virus size is large enough for the masks to catch it, and is not transmitted through the air. Viruses are acellular- without a cell body. Their major constituents are genetic material such as RNA. Therefore, the details about the cell size in the viral text stand invalid. Coronaviruses are ~125 nm in size (Fehr & Perlman, 2015) , where one nanometre (nm) is 1/1000 of a micrometre (μm). Despite that, they are one of the largest known RNA viruses (Sexton et al. 2016) , still smaller than bacteria and human cells. The figure below (adapted from Lumen, microbiology ) gives a visual representation of the virus size in comparison with atoms, proteins and lipid molecules and bacteria, plant and animal cells. Thus, the coronavirus can penetrate through masks through tiny viral clusters as well as through the eyes. However, masks on an infected person can prevent water droplets with coronavirus from dispersing into the air. This air transmission is the main method through which the coronavirus or other viruses infecting the respiratory tracts are transmitted. The U.S. Surgeon General also advised against using the masks in this tweet. Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus , but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk! https://t.co/UxZRwxxKL9 — U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) February 29, 2020 However, The Time magazine reported from David Hui , a respiratory medicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studied the 2002 to 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) extensively, says it’s “common sense” that wearing a mask would protect against infectious diseases like COVID-19 if “you are standing in front of someone who is sick”. Also, patients with COVID-19 often have mild symptoms or a complete lack of symptoms but may be contagious to other people unknowingly. Thus masks can be an effective strategy in enclosed areas to prevent the spread of infections to other people. Hence, the virus, despite being large is not large enough to be unable to penetrate the pores of a fabric mask, but infected people wearing masks is an effective way to prevent the spread and the aerosols (clusters of the virus in the air droplets) can be caught in a mask. The virus can also be transmitted through eyes as air droplets are the main mode of virus transmission. 2. A precise lifespan of the virus outside the human body. A new-preprint study (Doremalen et al 2020) conducted by American scientists suggests that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces for as long as 2-3 days. The study also suggests that the virus can spread through the air as well as from touching things that were contaminated by those who are infected as well as through direct human contact. They tested the virus by spraying into the air by a nebuliser mimicking the coughing action of an infected person. They learnt that could be detected up to 3 hours later in the air, up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces. Thus, it is true that the virus can survive on surfaces for longer, but the claim in the text has no references to the study or has correctly mentioned the duration of its survival on different surfaces. 3. The claim that coronavirus does not survive in warm temperatures of 26-27 deg C or exposure to sunlight. Epidemiologists have warned that there is so little information available on the spread of COVID-19 due to the novelty of this virus, that any information of its behaviour during the warmer weather will only be a prediction based on the previous SARS and MERS epidemics. Also, the incidence of transmission in warmer countries such as Singapore and Australia suggests that the virus can survive in hotter climates. However, warmer weather is not an independent variable controlling the spread of the virus. Humidity, the likelihood of social interactions during the warmer months, and the extent of public health measures can add to the drop in the spread of COVID-19, or “the flattening of the curve”. Additionally, another pre-print study by Mauricio Santillana and colleagues (2020) from the Harvard Medical School, Boston suggests that the virus exhibited the potential for sustained transmission and exponential growth across a range of temperatures and humidity levels in China such as the humid tropics, cold areas and dry areas. 4. Claim that washing with a soap to kill the coronavirus. This is the only claim that is unequivocally true among most viral texts. Soap is effective and easy for killing the coronavirus. See figure below (adapted from CDC ). From the schematic figure of the COVID-19 virus, the nanoparticle is enveloped by a fatty layer (grey layer from the figure) which is the weakest link assembling the structure together. Water alone cannot break this link or bonds of the fatty layer (lipids), but soap being an amphiphile- a substance which has both water-loving (hydrophilic) and fat-loving (lipophilic) molecules, binds to the fatty layer of the virus and detaches the layer which disassembles the virus structure, thereby killing the virus. 5. Claim that drinking hot water, gargling with warm salt water and avoiding ice-cream can protect you from coronavirus. Drinking or gargling with hot water or eating ice cream does not make a difference to coronavirus infections. Neither cold nor hot temperatures can kill coronavirus. WHO has released a series of infographics countering this claim. Trying to kill the virus by drinking or washing with hot water can burn the skin. Conclusion This viral texts claiming to be from UNICEF is one of many sets of misinformation on social media. Not only is it dishonestly trying to derive its credibility by claiming to be from UNICEF, but the misinformation is also a combination of individual pieces of hearsay, dangerous misinformation and some legitimate information. This viral message also has the propensity to push people to simple yet ineffective methods of gargling hot and saltwater, or not using masks for infected people, when they should seek medical attention for prompt isolation and medical attention. Moreover, UNICEF Sri Lanka has clarified that the infographic attributed to the UN body is false. “UNICEF does not issue coronavirus advisories on chat apps.

This wasn’t backed with evidence and the reports add that the same hasn’t been verified. For instance, The Sun’s article reads, “But it is not certain that the high SO2 levels are due to burning virus victims because the colourless gas is also produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil and through industry.” India Times and Daily Mail have pulled down their reports. Fact-check Alt News reached out to Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, a remote sensing expert at World Resources Institute, India. “The images that have been shared as satellite images are not really satellite images. These are in fact results of the GEOS-5 Model which are visualized and shared by w indy.com . The ones shown in images are forecasted levels of SO2 and are not observations,” said Palanichamy. Palanichamy added, “The GEOS-5 model uses emission inventories which had been created prior to model runs and the forecast runs do not include live observations. Any short term (particularly unpredictable) change in artificial pollutant sources won’t play any role in the outcome of the model. The SO2 forecast maps produced by models hence should not be related to Novel Coronavirus or socio-economic effects caused by it. On the other hand, SO2 levels could be monitored by ground stations and satellite images. They don’t show any unusual changes in the said time periods as the news articles claim.” When Alt News inquired why were the Windy readings so high, Palanichamy explained, “The W indy image being a model based on emission inventories for artificial sources and the dispersion of pollutants is determined by meteorological phenomena. Since the model assumes business as usual scenario for artificial sources and wouldn’t account for short term changes, the highly pollutant Chinese cities like Wuhan have higher values.” While responding to queries on Windy’s ‘general discussion’ page , Korina Karamalaki, community manager at Windy responded, “w indy.com gets the SO2 mass data from NASA model GEOS-5, but we don’t display archive data. There is an explanation of data right in the layer.” The screenshot below shows the Windy homepage – the button highlighted in yellow gives information about data displayed. The section highlighted in red shows that the data is indeed sourced from NASA. On February 13, Full Fact, a UK-based independent fact-checking charity, reported on the issue. Dr Arlindo M da Silva, a research meteorologist from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, told the organization that the GEOS-5 sulfur dioxide models do not “assimilate real satellite data” into their forecasts, instead are based on past evidence of emission levels. ‘Verifying GEOS-5 sulfur dioxide simulations, a 2013 research by NASA’s Global Modelling and Assimilation Office , stated, “when comparing modelled SO2 with observed (blue) SO2 from a sampling station during the 2010 Frostburg field campaign, the control run (red) overestimated SO2 by a factor of 4-5, and though the results were much better in the revised run (black), they were still high.” Real-time data shows no concerns about SO2 levels According to the World Air Quality Index project, a non-profit project started in 2007, the index of SO2 level in Wuhan has been rated good air quality index since February 10 (Monday). The project provides air quality information for more than 100 countries, covering more than 12,000 stations in 1,000 major cities, via two websites: aqicn.org and waqi.info . Some facts about SO2 levels generated during cremations ‘Emission characteristics of harmful air pollutants from cremators in Beijing, China,’ a journal published in May 2018 by National Center for Biotechnology Information studies states, “The process of corpse cremation generates numerous harmful air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and heavy metals.” The emission concentrations are affected by various factors such as “fuel type, cremator type, flue gas post-treatment system and operational maintenance.” The journal provides an infographic that compares the levels of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants emitted with/ without post-treatment. As per the infographic, SO2 concentration is the least out of all the pollutants. Neither did any media reports mention this fact, nor did they provide any information on the emissions of other major pollutants during cremations. Open , a Milan-based nonprofit media organization, also published a fact-check on February 12. They reached out to Pellegrino Conte, a chemistry professor at the University of Palermo, who said concentration must be greater than 50 micrograms/kg in order to have damage. As per Conte’s calculation, 50 micrograms of SO2 per cubic meter of air in the first 10-kilometres of Wuhan’s air space would mean 30 million bodies have been cremated. Euro News also quoted Conte in their fact-check on February 13. Since February 10, several media outlets – national and international – have published a report saying that an increase in sulfur dioxide levels in Wuhan and Chongqing is possibly linked with mass cremation of coronavirus victims. These reports include a screenshot of an image from windy.com, a Czech-based weather service, as the primary source to show “sulfur dioxide levels in Wuhan were at a staggering 1,350 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3).” Some of the media organizations which published this report are Daily Mail, The Sun (archive link), WION (archive link) and India Times. On February 9, Twitter account @inteldotwav posted (archive link) the same image from Windy and said that massive release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas from the outskirts of Wuhan is commonly associated with the burning of organic matters.

Dr Arlindo M da Silva, a research meteorologist from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, told the organization that the GEOS-5 sulfur dioxide models do not “assimilate real satellite data” into their forecasts, instead are based on past evidence of emission levels. ‘Verifying GEOS-5 sulfur dioxide simulations, a 2013 research by NASA’s Global Modelling and Assimilation Office, stated, “when comparing modelled SO2 with observed (blue) SO2 from a sampling station during the 2010 Frostburg field campaign, the control run (red) overestimated SO2 by a factor of 4-5, and though the results were much better in the revised run (black), they were still high.” Time series from 2010 of daily averaged SO2 concentrations at Piney run. Blue represents observations, red the control run, and black the revised run. Figure from Buchard et al. (2013) Real-time data shows no concerns about SO2 levels According to the World Air Quality Index project, a non-profit project started in 2007, the index of SO2 level in Wuhan has been rated good air quality index since February 10 (Monday). The project provides air quality information for more than 100 countries, covering more than 12,000 stations in 1,000 major cities, via two websites: aqicn.org and waqi.info. Some facts about SO2 levels generated during cremations ‘Emission characteristics of harmful air pollutants from cremators in Beijing, China,’ a journal published in May 2018 by National Center for Biotechnology Information studies states, “The process of corpse cremation generates numerous harmful air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and heavy metals.” The emission concentrations are affected by various factors such as “fuel type, cremator type, flue gas post-treatment system and operational maintenance.” The journal provides an infographic that compares the levels of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants emitted with/ without post-treatment. As per the infographic, SO2 concentration is the least out of all the pollutants. Neither did any media reports mention this fact, nor did they provide any information on the emissions of other major pollutants during cremations. Open, a Milan-based nonprofit media organization, also published a fact-check on February 12. They reached out to Pellegrino Conte, a chemistry professor at the University of Palermo, who said concentration must be greater than 50 micrograms/kg in order to have damage. As per Conte’s calculation, 50 micrograms of SO2 per cubic meter of air in the first 10-kilometres of Wuhan’s air space would mean 30 million bodies have been cremated. Euro News also quoted Conte in their fact-check on February 13. Therefore, the claim that the increase in sulfur dioxide (SO2) might be a sign of mass cremations in Wuhan cannot be ascertained using windy.com’s data. As per the World Air Quality Index, SO2 levels in Wuhan are not concerning.",Archit,False,False,1

Alt News has received multiple fact-check requests on its official mobile application available on Google Play Store. False H5N1 and Coronavirus are two distinct infections, where H5N1 rarely infects people-people, Coronavirus is most infectious if people get in contact with those who are infected. In parallel to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the Chinese government has now confirmed another highly pathogenic strain of the H5N1 bird flu in Hunan province. The 18,000 chickens that had been culled in Shaoyang city in the southern province of Hunan were due to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak, as confirmed by China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Between 2003-2020, WHO data suggests that H5N1 avian flu has killed 455 people worldwide. The influenza A virus subtype H5N1, also known as A(H5N1) or simply H5N1, can be treated in humans by available antiviral medicines. The H5N1 virus is sensitive to high heat 70 degrees C or more. Average temperatures used for cooking, 100 degrees C or more (which is the boiling point of water) will denature the virus . To date, no evidence indicates that any person has become infected with the H5N1 virus following the consumption of properly cooked poultry or its products, even in cases where the food item contained the virus prior to cooking. The 18,000 chickens were thus culled due to H5N1 avian flu, and not the Coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). While thoroughly cooked chicken remains safe for consumption, a large number of human infections with the H5N1 virus have been linked to home slaughter and improper handling of infected or dead chicken carcasses before cooking. Proper handling and cooking of chickens and other types of poultry can further lower the risk of human infections. China culled around 18,000 chickens in Shaoyang city in the southern province of Hunan as a result of a flu outbreak, amidst the coronavirus epidemic. Social media rumours in India started circulating, mostly in Marathi and Hindi, that the broiler chicken has been infected with Coronavirus and people should avoid consuming it.

Common symptoms include cough, fever, shortness of breath (dyspnea), and occasional diarrhoea. Currently, there are no vaccines for this infection and preventative measures are best to contain the spread of the infection.

Store it in a bottle and take sips as and when required. For prophylactic measures immune system need to be strengthened for this purpose Khamira Marwareed 3-5 gm once a day may be taken,” advises the Ministry of AYUSH. False Alt News sci-checked each of the components in the claim within the Unani papers to evaluate if the claims of prophylactic, preventative measures for CoV, or any other respiratory infections, hold true. Behidana (Cydonia Oblonga): While no research data was found in human studies that could determine the efficacy of ‘Behidana’ either preventatively, or as a symptomatic treatment for CoV/flu-like infections. There were several general pre-clinical and review papers of Behidana (Cydonia Oblonga). The most prominent one was a review article from Pakistan by Ashraf and colleagues in 2016, that suggested the uses of ‘Behidana’ (Cydonia Oblonga) or Quince. We specifically searched for any research conducted on respiratory problems within this review paper. It claimed that Quince can treat respiratory tract disorders including cold sores, rhinitis and cough as per Nadkarni, 1976 and Duke et al., 2002 , amongst many other diseases. Nadkarni, 1976 is the ‘Indian Materia Medica book for Ayurvedic, Unani, allopathic, homeopathic, naturopathic and home remedies’ that listed Quince, once, as a ‘popular remedy’ on page 1038, section 2079, under ‘Pyrus Cydonia’. Similarly, Duke et al 2002, is another ‘handbook of medicinal herbs’ by the American botanist James Duke, again devoid of any research data. Thus, there is no research for Behidana as an asymptomatic or preventative treatment for flu-like symptoms, only reviews with opinions that suggest it is a ‘popular remedy’. Unnab Zizyphus (Jujube Linn): We found one Unani review article in the ‘World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research’ that detailed the benefits of ‘Unnab’ (red date) in a concoction. The article was published by Talib and colleagues by Jamia Hamdard, School of Unani Medicine in 2017, and listed the benefits (or “Mawaq-e-Istemal”) related to respiratory problems as below: “Constipation, Dry cough, Sore throat, Busoor (skin eruptions).[39, 40]” When we checked the references, 39 and 40 quoted in the review papers, they did not turn out to be published research articles or book chapters based on Unani research. Thus, again, no research evidence was found that studied Unnab (red dates) for flu-like symptoms. Sapistan (Cordia Myxa Linn): We found a prominent review article that discussed the role of ‘Sapistan’ in symptomatic treatments for respiratory diseases by Al-Snafi (2016) from Thi Qar University, Iraq. Studying the section on respiratory benefits, they claimed that Cordia Myxa relaxed the smooth muscles of the trachea in sheep and cited the Al-Bayaty (2008) paper . Neither the review (2016) nor the 2008 paper referred to any human studies with symptoms of the respiratory tract, thus giving no researched evidence to support Sapistan as an effective symptomatic treatment for respiratory diseases. Khamira Marwareed: No studies were found assessing the role of ‘Khamira Marwareed’ for immune or respiratory function as claimed by the AYUSH advisory. However, some reviews suggested it could be cardio-protective, the evidence for which was not studied due to lack of relevance. Again, no evidence was found to suggest the efficacy of Khamira Marwareed in changing immune or respiratory functions. Thus, no scientific evidence as research data was found corresponding to the Unani herbs advised by the AYUSH Ministry that would help to back their claim on Unani formulations for preventative or symptomatic treatments for Coronavirus. We also checked the corresponding scientific names of these herbs in fruitless efforts for obtaining data in the evidence-based literature. Unlike the information provided in the advisory by the Government of India, Unani can provide neither symptomatic nor preventative treatment for CoV infections or any other respiratory tract diseases.

Recently, three cases of CoV infection were confirmed in Kerala and three suspected cases were reported in Delhi. Countries such as Russia have closed borders from China to prevent the spread of this infection.

It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021 , which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch . However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed on a black stone is viral on social media. It is claimed that this stone was found in Afghanistan. Viral messages claim that though the stone is cool from the outside, it can melt anything made of steel and iron when placed in contact. Twitter user @kabirkhan488 shared the clip with the same claim.

(Link 1, Link 2, Link 3) افغانستان کے صوبہ وردک میں ایک ایسا پتھر دریافت ہوا ھے جو اوپر سے ٹھنڈا ھے لیکن اگر اسٹیل یا لوہا اوپر رکھے تو پگھلاتا ھے۔۔ یہ کون سا پتھر ہو سکتا ہے pic.twitter.com/4sXl6w9LRL — Sajid Mehmood (@Sajid_Mehmood_5) November 28, 2021 Not a magical stone We performed a reverse image search using stills from the video, which led us to an article on a website called masralyoum.net. It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021, which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch. However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. This confirms that the stone seen in the video is not magical. But the phenomenon seen in the video can be attributed to the nails being made of gallium, a metal with a low melting point of 85.6°F.",Kinjal,False,False,1

Evidence for Arsenicum album 30 for coronavirus: No studies were found that researched the effect of Arsenicum album for coronavirus in humans or animals (in vivo). Also, there were also no studies found in an ex-vivo (outside the animal/human bodies) to study the drug efficacy. 2.Evidence for any homeopathy drug for coronavirus: No studies were found that linked the efficacy of any homeopathy drug in coronavirus infections 3.

This study was not only in animals on a different type of infection, but was found to be statistically invalid by Verdier, Öhagen & Alenius in 2003 . Thus, Arsenicum album 30 has not been proven or researched scientifically by homeopaths to cure coronavirus or any other infections in humans. Internationally as well as in India, the AYUSH ministry and the Indian government has met with a lot of criticism for issuing the advisory to use homeopathy as a preventative measure. Alt News sci-checked the homeopathic research behind the drug Arsenicum album 30 for the prevention of coronavirus infections. As with other homeopathic drugs, Arsenicum album 30 has never been tested or proven to reduce coronavirus infections or to prevent coronavirus infections. Even though the focus was to study the research conducted by the homeopaths, no studies were found by non-homeopaths within the evidence-based framework that suggests the use of Arsenicum album 30 for coronavirus. The claim of the AYUSH ministry and the AYUSH homeopaths is false, dangerous and can lead to India’s own coronavirus epidemic, as the infected patients’ caregivers can assume false protection based on the government of India’s advisory.

https://www.altnews.in/dengue-cannot-be-cured-with-homeopathic-treatment-eupatorium-perfoliatum/,Dengue cannot be cured or prevented with homeopathic treatment Eupatorium Perfoliatum,https://i0.wp.com/www.altnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Untitled-design-2019-11-22T161210.832-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C157&ssl=1,2019-11-22 11:41:35,2019-12-01 01:36:02,"Like every year, the cases for mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue, have spiked in different parts of India after the end of the summer season. This year the epidemic has...",,"In Delhi, 75 cases of dengue, 21 of chikungunya, and 131 cases of malaria have been reported until the end of August 2019. In 2017 and 2018 in Delhi, 4726 dengue cases with 10 deaths and 2798 dengue cases with 4 deaths were reported respectively. In Telangana, a severely affected state, this year alone over 4500 dengue cases have been reported with the highest outbreak in August and September. The death count due to dengue in Telangana has been estimated of above 50 which includes minors.Dengue is a viral disease that spreads through mosquitoes with no known cures but treatable symptomatically using evidence-based medications. Previously, Alt News Science conducted a sci-Check on the evidence available for papaya, and its leaf extracts drug ‘Caripill’ for the treatment of dengue. No evidence was found to suggest that papaya or ‘Caripill’ can be effective in treating dengue or raising the platelet count.The newly developed vaccine Dengvaxia and TAK-003 are undergoing large systematic trials for safety and efficacy before it can be available worldwide as a robust form of preventative or treatment measure.Subsequently, many forms of alternative treatments in India have emerged that claim to cure and/or prevent Dengue. Other than using papaya, one of the most common claims include using homeopathy for dengue.Eupatorium Perfoliatum (EP), a Homeopathic preparation is preventative and curative for high risk as well as dengue infected populations.Along with the viral WhatsApp forwards, YouTube videos and other social media content that has been consistently making this claim, the National Health Portal (NHP) , has listed Eupatorium Perfoliatum as the most commonly indicated for Dengue. EP along with 12 other homeopathic medications has been indicated as a preventative as well as a curative treatment for Dengue.The NHP is an official portal designed, developed and hosted by the Centre for Health Informatics (CHI), set up at the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW), by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India.Alt News found multiple mainstream media reports of Eupatorium Perfoliatum being given to patients by Government organisations. ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 )Study 1: Non scientific study design with lack of appropriate controlsIn Brazil, a single dose of Eupatorium Perfoliatum was administered preventatively between January- May 2001 to 40% of the population in the most affected neighbourhood. Results from this study showed 81% reduction in dengue incidences between May-December 2001 from that neighbourhood as compared to other non-treated neighborhood. The other treated areas showed a reduction of 58%, 39%, 37% and 10% in dengue incidences during that period.However, the study did not show the prevalence or reduction of dengue incidence in the treated areas from the previous years when no treatment was administered. A comparison of reduction in dengue can only be made if the incidences from the same area is compared with and without EP dosage. Thus, due to lack of comparative controls, it cannot be determined that EP indeed have an impact on dengue reduction.Study 2: Conference paper, not a peer-reviewed paper, and lack of dataThe double blind controlled trial quoted from Novaes (2015) is a conference proceeding, not a peer review paper, repeatedly cited as conclusive proof of efficacy by many sources, but neither the data is cited nor the published paper is available for viewership.Study 3: Falsified and misrepresented data from 25 patientsIn Pakistan, a combination of homeopathic remedies including Eupatorium Perfoliatum was given to 25 dengue patients ( Hassan et al 2003 ). Their full blood count (FBC) including platelet count (PLT), white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit level (HCT) were recorded instead of the change in viral load and was compared with the non-treated group. However, the comparison was conducted at the end of the 6-day dengue infection period.Their study quoted that, in the homeopathic treated group platelet count increased from (95.60 ± 0.04) x 10 3 to (311 ± 0.13) x 10 3 /μL, while the standard maintenance therapy (control) increased platelet count from (73.44 ± 0.04) x 10 3 to (239.00 ± 0.04) x 10 3 /μL.It was claimed, in this study as well as in other reviews of this study, that the relative change from approximately 95,000 (day 0) to 311,000 (day 6) per μL in the homeopathy treated group was larger than the relative change in the control group, i.e. 73,000 (day 0) to 239,000 (day 6) per μL.Alt News Science calculated the % change in platelets between the two groups. If the baseline platelets at day 0 for both groups is treated as 100%,Day 6 Homeopathy = (311,000 x 100)/95,000= 327%Day 6 Control = (239,000 x 100)/72,000= 332%Thus, there were no significant differences in platelet increase between the homeopathy treated group and the group with standard treatment, as the platelet count increased from day 0 to day 6.Hence, Hassan et al’s conclusion of homeopathy combination treatment group being more effective is a falsification and misrepresentation of results. Subsequently, this research study is not a proof of efficacy for EP or the combination of homeopathic remedies for dengue.Study 4: Lack of evidence for efficacyIn Honduras, a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of a homeopathic combination medication, including EP, for 60 dengue patients was carried out in municipal health clinics by Jacobs et al 2007 .As per their own conclusion from Jacobs at et 2007, the results showed no difference in outcomes between homeopathy treated group vs. the placebo group, including the number of days of fever and pain as well as analgesic use and complication rate. The study did not evaluate blood count or viral load as a parameter for homeopathic treatment efficacy.Review studies:A review paper published by Raj Manchanda in 2015 , The Editor in Chief, Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), India listed the global studies, reviewed above, to conclude Eupatorium Perfoliatum (EP) efficacy for dengue.Another review paper from the Regional Research Institute for Homoeopathy, India by Bawaskar & Shinde (2019) listed the same studies and detailed the results but did not analyse or “peer-review” the data to validate its authenticity.The data paper published in Pakistan is a serious breach in research conduct for which the paper should not have allowed to be published or cited several times. Additionally, that Pakistani paper was cited without criticism of misrepresentation by the editor in chief of CCRH, India ( Manchandana, 2015 ) and in another review paper from India by Bawaskar & Shinde (2019) .The limited number of studies, largely concluding efficacy in review papers, lack of empirical data as well as falsification of data presented no evidence for Eupatorium Perfoliatum (EP), or EP with a combination of other homeopathic drugs to be effective in treating or preventing dengue.The majority of criticism towards evidence-based scientists conducting research to test homeopathy efficacy is dismissed by the homeopaths. Here, we used homeopathy research studies to reveal lack of efficacy, misrepresented and falsified data.This does not counter that homeopathy itself is based on principles not acknowledged by evidence-based medicine.

Homœopathic Links. 2019 Mar;32(01):010-7.Available from: https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0039-1687897#JR1920069-19 Data papers: Like every year, the cases for mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue, have spiked in different parts of India after the end of the summer season. This year the epidemic has lasted much longer than the previous years, while a 16-year-old girl died from dengue on the 10th of November 2019 at the Delhi hospital. In Delhi, 75 cases of dengue, 21 of chikungunya, and 131 cases of malaria have been reported until the end of August 2019. In 2017 and 2018 in Delhi, 4726 dengue cases with 10 deaths and 2798 dengue cases with 4 deaths were reported respectively. In Telangana, a severely affected state, this year alone over 4500 dengue cases have been reported with the highest outbreak in August and September. The death count due to dengue in Telangana has been estimated of above 50 which includes minors. Dengue is a viral disease that spreads through mosquitoes with no known cures but treatable symptomatically using evidence-based medications. Previously, Alt News Science conducted a sci-Check on the evidence available for papaya, and its leaf extracts drug ‘Caripill’ for the treatment of dengue. No evidence was found to suggest that papaya or ‘Caripill’ can be effective in treating dengue or raising the platelet count. The newly developed vaccine Dengvaxia and TAK-003 are undergoing large systematic trials for safety and efficacy before it can be available worldwide as a robust form of preventative or treatment measure. Subsequently, many forms of alternative treatments in India have emerged that claim to cure and/or prevent Dengue. Other than using papaya, one of the most common claims include using homeopathy for dengue. Claim: Eupatorium Perfoliatum (EP), a Homeopathic preparation is preventative and curative for high risk as well as dengue infected populations. Along with the viral WhatsApp forwards, YouTube videos and other social media content that has been consistently making this claim, the National Health Portal (NHP), has listed Eupatorium Perfoliatum as the most commonly indicated for Dengue. EP along with 12 other homeopathic medications has been indicated as a preventative as well as a curative treatment for Dengue. The NHP is an official portal designed, developed and hosted by the Centre for Health Informatics (CHI), set up at the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW), by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India. Alt News found multiple mainstream media reports of Eupatorium Perfoliatum being given to patients by Government organisations. (1, 2, 3, 4) Fact Check: Study 1: Non scientific study design with lack of appropriate controls Marino R. Homeopathy and Collective Health: The Case of Dengue Epidemics. Int J High Dilution Res 2008;7:179-85 In Brazil, a single dose of Eupatorium Perfoliatum was administered preventatively between January- May 2001 to 40% of the population in the most affected neighbourhood. Results from this study showed 81% reduction in dengue incidences between May-December 2001 from that neighbourhood as compared to other non-treated neighborhood. The other treated areas showed a reduction of 58%, 39%, 37% and 10% in dengue incidences during that period. However, the study did not show the prevalence or reduction of dengue incidence in the treated areas from the previous years when no treatment was administered. A comparison of reduction in dengue can only be made if the incidences from the same area is compared with and without EP dosage. Thus, due to lack of comparative controls, it cannot be determined that EP indeed have an impact on dengue reduction. Study 2: Conference paper, not a peer-reviewed paper, and lack of data The double blind controlled trial quoted from Novaes (2015) is a conference proceeding, not a peer review paper, repeatedly cited as conclusive proof of efficacy by many sources, but neither the data is cited nor the published paper is available for viewership. Study 3: Falsified and misrepresented data from 25 patients In Pakistan, a combination of homeopathic remedies including Eupatorium Perfoliatum was given to 25 dengue patients (Hassan et al 2003). Their full blood count (FBC) including platelet count (PLT), white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit level (HCT) were recorded instead of the change in viral load and was compared with the non-treated group. However, the comparison was conducted at the end of the 6-day dengue infection period. Their study quoted that, in the homeopathic treated group platelet count increased from (95.60 ± 0.04) x 103 to (311 ± 0.13) x 103/μL, while the standard maintenance therapy (control) increased platelet count from (73.44 ± 0.04) x 103 to (239.00 ± 0.04) x 103/μL. It was claimed, in this study as well as in other reviews of this study, that the relative change from approximately 95,000 (day 0) to 311,000 (day 6) per μL in the homeopathy treated group was larger than the relative change in the control group, i.e. 73,000 (day 0) to 239,000 (day 6) per μL. Alt News Science calculated the % change in platelets between the two groups. If the baseline platelets at day 0 for both groups is treated as 100%, Day 6 Homeopathy = (311,000 x 100)/95,000= 327% Day 6 Control = (239,000 x 100)/72,000= 332% Thus, there were no significant differences in platelet increase between the homeopathy treated group and the group with standard treatment, as the platelet count increased from day 0 to day 6. Hence, Hassan et al’s conclusion of homeopathy combination treatment group being more effective is a falsification and misrepresentation of results. Subsequently, this research study is not a proof of efficacy for EP or the combination of homeopathic remedies for dengue. Study 4: Lack of evidence for efficacy In Honduras, a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of a homeopathic combination medication, including EP, for 60 dengue patients was carried out in municipal health clinics by Jacobs et al 2007. As per their own conclusion from Jacobs at et 2007, the results showed no difference in outcomes between homeopathy treated group vs. the placebo group, including the number of days of fever and pain as well as analgesic use and complication rate. The study did not evaluate blood count or viral load as a parameter for homeopathic treatment efficacy. Review studies: A review paper published by Raj Manchanda in 2015, The Editor in Chief, Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), India listed the global studies, reviewed above, to conclude Eupatorium Perfoliatum (EP) efficacy for dengue. Another review paper from the Regional Research Institute for Homoeopathy, India by Bawaskar & Shinde (2019) listed the same studies and detailed the results but did not analyse or “peer-review” the data to validate its authenticity. Conclusion: The data paper published in Pakistan is a serious breach in research conduct for which the paper should not have allowed to be published or cited several times.

Both were preliminary studies that tested the effect of coconut oil on bacterial infections with dental caries and hospital-acquired diarrhoea. The bacteria associated with dental caries is Streptococcus mutans and with hospital-acquired diarrhoea is Clostridium difficile , both are distinct organisms as compared to the dengue virus.Thus, limited evidence from preliminary studies of antibacterial activity does not translate to efficacy as antiviral activity.B: No evidence for coconut oil as an antiviral:No studies were found that mentioned coconut oil as an effective antiviral agent.

We found several articles written on the phenomenon which is not uncommon and has been seen at various places around the world. A sun halo or 22 degree Halo is a ring caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals in cirrus clouds within the earth’s atmosphere, according to University of Illinois’ Weather World Project 2010 explainer on the topic. The ring is formed around the sun or moon. While primary rainbows are red on the outside and violet on the inside, sun halos are red inside and violet outside. In the comparison below, an image of the primary rainbow (left) has been juxtaposed with a sun halo (right). It may be reiterated here that a halo surrounds a sun or moon. Sun halos photographed during the days (two on the left) and nights (two on the right) around the world have been placed in the collage posted below to depict that it is not an uncommon phenomenon. In 2018, The Hindu had reported an incident of people in Shivmogga district of Karnataka witnessing a similar 22-degree halo. “Haronahalli Swamy, a functionary of Shivamogga Amateur Astronomers Association, told The Hindu that the ‘Sun Halo,’ a circle of light with 22 degree radius, is produced when sun light is refracted in hexagonal suspended ice crystals and super cool water droplets formed in the cirrus clouds. The halo is created when the Sun is aligned with these crystals at a particular angle” , stated the report. While the video posted by Anand Mahindra depicts a sun halo, a full circle rainbow has also been spotted several times around the world. An explanation given in a Slate Magazine article reads, “We see rainbows in the sky because in general, the ground is close to you. When we look up toward the sky we see for a long way, and there are lots of raindrops along your eyeline that can add their light together to make the rainbow. When you look down, the ground gets in the way, there aren’t as many drops, and you don’t see a rainbow.” The official website of the United Kingdom’s Met Office also reiterated, “The key factor that determines how much of a rainbow we see is our visual reference point. In most cases we only see less than half of a circle – the characteristic rainbow arc we are all familiar with. However, if you are lucky enough to be in the right position at the right time, you can see a full circle rainbow in all its splendour.” The article In cases of a rainbow, sunlight that enters individual droplets of liquid water bends or refract multiple times.

US Report pic.twitter.com/WMFp9yVWzp — Rajnish Sharma (@rajnish1Midas) June 28, 2019 The articles quoted Shiv Shankar Gupta, and alleged that America West Analytical Laboratory, had ‘revealed’ that two brands of salt, consumed en masse in India contained alarmingly high levels of potassium ferrocyanide (PFC). The levels reported were: 4.71 mg/Kg in Sambhar refined salt, 1.85 mg/Kg in Tata salt, and 1.9 mg/Kg in Tata salt lite. The article reported stated that Mr Gupta, suggested that nowhere else in the world was PFC permitted in the edible salt industry, and described it as ‘a deadly poison’. In addition to mainstream news outlets, Website called Great Game India published a story about presence of toxic chemicals in two brands of salt widely used in India. Beyond the reportage by IANS, this article also points out to a pending public interest litigation (PIL) and other related information. In the course of this article, we will examine the following claims made in the aforementioned press conference and the media report that covered it: 1) The veracity of the US lab report based on which the ‘toxic salt’ claim was made 2) Whether Potassium Ferrocyanide (PFC) is toxic for human consumption 3) Whether PFC is a legal component in food consumption of other countries 4) The differences between PFC and cyanide- a highly toxic substance linked with instant death We found the claim regarding the levels of PFC as reported by an American Lab as false. In an email exchange with the American West Analytical Laboratories , the labs were requested for the information regarding the laboratory tests conducted on the various salt brands, which were subsequently claimed by Gupta. Kyle Gross, Director of American West analytical laboratories, responded with a prepared statement categorically denying that they cannot analyse or disperse information on PFC levels, as well as refrain from commenting on the client or the work conducted at the lab to the third parties, i.e. Mr Gupta . The full statement is available here . The second false claim was that PFC is toxic and that the allegedly reported levels of PFc in salt samples from India were alarmingly high.PFC’s use as a food additive in salt arises from its anti-caking properties allowing salt to be ‘ free-flowing ’. This has the obvious advantage that the quantities of salt used for human consumption can be more fine-tuned as compared with rock-salt. The toxicity and safety of PFC and other ferrocyanide salts (such as sodium and calcium) was comprehensively reviewed in 2018 by an expert panel of the European Food Safety Authority. This review concluded that the use of potassium (as well as sodium or calcium) ferrocyanides as food additives presented no reason for concern. It was neither genotoxic (i.e. it did not alter the genetic make-up of cells), nor carcinogenic (causing cancerous tumours). In very large quantities, its toxicity was demonstrated in rodent kidneys and adverse effects were observed at about 4.1 mg/Kg PFC of body weight everyday over a two year period. For human consumption, the expert panel concluded that the acceptable daily intake of PFC was 0.03 mg/Kg body weight per day expressed as the ferro-cyanide ion. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India also clarified that allowed levels of PFC is 10 mg per Kg of salt and that the reported limits in media were well within the allowed limits. Ferrocyanides are used as anti-caking agents in processing of salt which is safe for consumption and they’re different… Posted by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India on Thursday, 27 June 2019 Furthermore, to attain a level of PFC of 10 mg/Kg, the required salt consumption for a human would be 3 gm of salt per Kg body weight. This amount for an average human of 70 Kg weight would be 210 gm every day. This level is highly unlikely in humans as the maximum salt intake is largely 10-12 gm per day. In comparison, the recommended salt intake for an adult is less than 6 grams a day. The third claim that is verifiably false is that it is illegal in other countries to use PFC in salt manufacturing. The European Food Safety Agency allows the use of PFC as an additive in salt and its substitutes like low sodium salts. For example the salt manufactured and sold by Premier Foods under the Saxa brand in many British supermarkets lists 2 ingredients , salt and an anti-caking agent (sodium hexacyanoferrate) Multiple media articles referred to PFC as ‘deadly cyanide’ in the title of their reports. Cyanide is the popular term used for Potassium Cyanide which is different from Potassium Ferrocyanide (PFC), the anti-caking-agent used in salts. This is deliberately misleading and misinformed.Potassium ferrocyanide is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ].3H 2 0. An alternative name for the ferrocyanide ion is hexacyanoferrate and may be preferable since it does not lead to a confusion with ‘cyanide’ for the lay person. The potassium, sodium and calcium salts of ferrocyanide (or hexacyanoferrate) have the same properties. Also, it does NOT decompose into cyanide which is a well-known lethal toxin. Hence, it is false and misleading to suggest that PFC is related to potassium cyanide. While the chemical bond between iron (Fe) and cyanide radical is strong. PFC is very poorly absorbed in humans between- 0.25 – 0.42% of the amount ingested. Salt is the oldest known food seasoning and preservative. India produces some 27 million tons of it and ranks third in the world behind USA and China. Within India, Tata Salt is the leading producer of cooking and table salt and markets its brand with the slogan, ‘ Desh ka namak ’. Tata Salt put out a statement rebutting the claims made by media organisations and Mr Gupta. They have argued that their salt does contain PFC, that the levels of PFC are well within the limits mandated by regulatory guidelines and that their salt is safe. Tata’s statement also gives web links to regulatory standards from around the world that set out the use of PFC as an additive. Science journalism in India is woefully lacking in rigour and understanding. This news report was easily refuted as it was based on concocted and demonstrably false statements.

The children present themselves in the early hours of the morning with symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea, altered consciousness or...",,"First reported from Muzzafarpur in 1995, subsequent large outbreaks almost every year, with a timely precision of April-July months (period of litchi harvest), mostly affecting 3-7-year-olds. Mortality is 40-60% and the largest number of affected children are malnourished and from rural areas specifically those around the litchi farms. Clinicians have attributed encephalopathy and its related deaths in these children due to a combination of a malnourishment induced lowered glucose levels, and the consumption of litchi fruits on an empty stomach. The Head of the Department, Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Bihar, Dr Gopal Shankar, discredited the causes of death in children to due litchi consumption and blamed it on the heat and reduced rainfall in the season. Furthermore, news headlines of a story reporting this issue in the Times of India , was published with the title “ “Litchi is not the culprit!” insists Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician ”. As opposed to the clickbait title which could create confusion on the safety and toxicity of litchi consumption, the body of the article reflected the paediatrician’s evidence-based opinion. Alt News has studied the scientific literature on such deaths in India due to litchi consumption for a fact check on the possible causes of this specific metabolic disease. Several scientific studies have established the link of litchi consumption to a disease similar to brain inflammation in children during the litchi harvesting season (May-July) since the end of the 1990s. In the Bac Giang Province of Northern Vietnam, a clear link was established between the onset of this epidemic with the time period as well as the area of the litchi harvest. In Vietnam, the annual risk for these symptoms increased with the proportion of litchi-cultivated surface. In the districts that harvested litchis during May-June, the epidemic occurred earlier than those districts in which the litchis were harvested in the June-July period. (Paireau, Juliette et al. 2012). In India, the harvesting period of litchi in various parts of the country is also in the months of May and June with Muzaffarpur, East Champaran, Samastipur, Vaisali, and Bhagalpur districts of Bihar accounting for 31% of the annual production of litchis in India. Thus, it is evident that the link to the time period of litchi harvest as well as the specific region of litchi production is critical to the recent deadly encephalopathy epidemic in India. In 2013-2014 , the National Centre for Disease Control, India (NCDC) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) initiated an investigation to identify the potential causes of the disease. The aim was to eliminate any other known pathogens or infectious agents, heavy metals or pesticides associated with litchi fruits that may have triggered the disease. The laboratory investigation found no evidence of the aforementioned possible causative agents, and data indicated that the illness was consistent with a non-inflammatory encephalopathy. Notably, a common laboratory finding was low blood glucose (<70 mg/dL) on admission (Shrivastava, Akash et al. 2015). Thus, this study was another confirmation that low glucose due to malnourishment and/or skipping meals the night before the symptoms start, were the determining factors of the children that presented with the disease in Bihar. A case study in India (Singh et al. 2016), suggested the same pattern of encephalopathy symptoms and its deaths overlapped the harvest season of litchis. This study also found significant associations of the disease with literacy status and occupational status of parents, both suggesting lower economic class and thus, increased the likelihood of malnourishment among those children. The study also significantly correlated the presence of lychee orchard near the vicinity of households. Thus, by determining the economic status of the families close to the specific litchi producing orchards, it was determined that poverty and malnourishment was a key determinant of the encephalopathy disease. Since all malnourished children did not suffer from the symptoms, it was clear that the consumption of litchi on empty stomachs triggered the onset. In 2017, a study of affected children using specimens such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid and urine were conducted to find the association between litchi consumption and the disease. While the tests determined the absence of infectious pathogens, pesticides, toxic metals, and other non-infectious causes in the tested specimens, it tested positive for the presence of hypoglycin A or methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG) (John, 2017). The same compounds are naturally occurring in litchis studied extensively by Das et al. 2015 , and Shah & John, 2014 Both hypoglycin A and MCPG cause hypoglycaemia (lowered glucose) and its associated metabolic derangement (shutting down of the organ systems) by blocking the mobilisation of glucose from stored liver reserves of glycogen (glucose polysaccharide). Since, these reserves are already low in malnourished children who have skipped evening meals, the effect of such compounds (hypoglycin A & MPCG) in them is the highest. To determine the causes, 104 cases were compared with other children of the same age who did not have the symptoms (controls), and it was deduced that litchi consumption and absence of an evening meal in the 24 hours preceding the start of symptoms were associated with the disease. These results were also correlated with low glucose, hypoglycin A, MCPG, or both, detected in the urine specimens of affected children. Since none of the above was detected from children unaffected by this specific form of encephalopathy i.e. those who did not have the symptoms, the results established the complex link between the litchi compounds and low glucose. Also, unripe litchi fruits are more problematic than their ripe counterparts, as they may contribute to a higher risk of low glucose-induced encephalopathy. This is due to the higher hypoglycin A and MCPG content in the unripe litchi fruits. Thus, it was concluded that the nature of the symptoms, and death, may not be due to an infectious agent such as virus or bacteria. While litchi alone was not the root cause of the disease and deaths, consuming the raw fruit on an empty stomach by a malnourished child can be severely life-threatening. In the aftermath of such events in China in 1995, the Chinese print media and local educational campaigns warning the public of the dangers of lychees increased in lychee-producing counties. Since 2000, only one paediatric and 48 adult cases of lychee disease have been reported. All 48 patients received emergency treatment with 50% glucose, and 47 survived (Zhang et al. 2017). Professor T Jacob John, CMC Vellore and Dr Arun Shah, Paediatrics, have determined that fast and complete recovery can be established if children are infused with 10% glucose within 4 hours of the onset of the symptoms. Thus, other lychee-producing countries such as India might benefit from regional public information, education, and, simple and fast medical intervention, i.e. within 4 hours of symptoms. Also, misinformation or falsely presented information such as ‘litchi is safe’ can be deadly, while explaining the link associated with malnourished children using social and print media as well as the government can potentially save many lives.

The children present themselves in the early hours of the morning with symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea, altered consciousness or unconsciousness. These symptoms are similar to those presented in cases of brain disorders such as inflammation or infection of the central nervous system (brain and/or the spinal cord) due to pathogens such as virus or bacteria. Clinical investigations have found that the deadly disease was falsely diagnosed as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The disease, in reality, is a metabolic disease called encephalopathy, occurring to due hypoglycaemia (dangerously low levels of glucose). First reported from Muzzafarpur in 1995, subsequent large outbreaks almost every year, with a timely precision of April-July months (period of litchi harvest), mostly affecting 3-7-year-olds. Mortality is 40-60% and the largest number of affected children are malnourished and from rural areas specifically those around the litchi farms. Clinicians have attributed encephalopathy and its related deaths in these children due to a combination of a malnourishment induced lowered glucose levels, and the consumption of litchi fruits on an empty stomach. Claim The Head of the Department, Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Bihar, Dr Gopal Shankar, discredited the causes of death in children to due litchi consumption and blamed it on the heat and reduced rainfall in the season. Furthermore, news headlines of a story reporting this issue in the Times of India, was published with the title ““Litchi is not the culprit!” insists Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician”. As opposed to the clickbait title which could create confusion on the safety and toxicity of litchi consumption, the body of the article reflected the paediatrician’s evidence-based opinion. Alt News has studied the scientific literature on such deaths in India due to litchi consumption for a fact check on the possible causes of this specific metabolic disease. Fact-Check Several scientific studies have established the link of litchi consumption to a disease similar to brain inflammation in children during the litchi harvesting season (May-July) since the end of the 1990s. Study 1 In the Bac Giang Province of Northern Vietnam, a clear link was established between the onset of this epidemic with the time period as well as the area of the litchi harvest. In Vietnam, the annual risk for these symptoms increased with the proportion of litchi-cultivated surface. In the districts that harvested litchis during May-June, the epidemic occurred earlier than those districts in which the litchis were harvested in the June-July period. (Paireau, Juliette et al. 2012). In India, the harvesting period of litchi in various parts of the country is also in the months of May and June with Muzaffarpur, East Champaran, Samastipur, Vaisali, and Bhagalpur districts of Bihar accounting for 31% of the annual production of litchis in India. Thus, it is evident that the link to the time period of litchi harvest as well as the specific region of litchi production is critical to the recent deadly encephalopathy epidemic in India. Study 2 In 2013-2014, the National Centre for Disease Control, India (NCDC) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) initiated an investigation to identify the potential causes of the disease. The aim was to eliminate any other known pathogens or infectious agents, heavy metals or pesticides associated with litchi fruits that may have triggered the disease. The laboratory investigation found no evidence of the aforementioned possible causative agents, and data indicated that the illness was consistent with a non-inflammatory encephalopathy. Notably, a common laboratory finding was low blood glucose (<70 mg/dL) on admission (Shrivastava, Akash et al. 2015). Thus, this study was another confirmation that low glucose due to malnourishment and/or skipping meals the night before the symptoms start, were the determining factors of the children that presented with the disease in Bihar. Study 3 A case study in India (Singh et al. 2016), suggested the same pattern of encephalopathy symptoms and its deaths overlapped the harvest season of litchis. This study also found significant associations of the disease with literacy status and occupational status of parents, both suggesting lower economic class and thus, increased the likelihood of malnourishment among those children.

It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch . However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively.

A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed on a black stone is viral on social media. It is claimed that this stone was found in Afghanistan.

This infection can also be passed from a...,,"On the 3rd of November 2018, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), in a press release titled “ Zika Virus strain that causes microcephaly not found in Rajasthan ”, stated that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had sequenced 5 Zika virus strains collected from Jaipur to determine genetic mutations that may lead to foetal microcephaly and high transmissibility related to the infection. The press release claimed that known mutations linked to microcephaly were not present in the Zika virus strain that had affected Rajasthan. This article will examine the aforementioned claim made in the MoHFW press release The ministry suggested that the results from this sequencing did not find any ‘known mutations’ linked to foetal microcephaly and high transmissibility. Thereby, the government is suggesting that: The Zika virus strain from India does not contain the microcephaly causing mutation The outbreaks is contained within small areas, thereby reducing the required precaution for pregnant women in India despite the warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in USA A study in 2017 by Yuan et al in the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Beijing, China, showed that ‘S139N’ gene mutation in the genetic material of Zika virus was responsible for increased virulence and increased damage to brain cells leading to microcephaly in new-borns. However, strains lacking the mutation also damaged neural cells. This study was performed on cells in the laboratory and gives little insights into human infection. This has been falsely interpreted by the ICMR to say that strains carrying S139N mutation are solely responsible for microcephaly. Additional studies suggest that strains of Zika strains without these mutations can cause birth defects. For example, a 2018 study from Thailand shows that even in the absence of S139N mutation, cases of microcephaly were reported. Dr Nathan Grubaugh, Assistant Professor, Yale School of Public Health has been involved with Zika epidemic studies of Brazil and US. He spoke to Alt News and expressed deep concerns regarding the policies implemented based on ‘known mutations.’ He stated that, “ There is no evidence stating S139N is responsible for 100% of the microcephaly cases. The available lab evidence suggests that any Zika virus strain may produce birth-defects. We should treat all strains as equally dangerous until further research says otherwise ”. He has expressed his thoughts in details in his articles in Cell Press Review and The Hindu . This sentiment was shared by other scientists, like Scott C. Weaver, a microbiologist at the University of Texas, who worked on the Brazilian outbreak. He said “ It is still too early to conclude that any particular strain cannot cause microcephaly. ” The National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune studied the Zika strains from 10 human serum samples from Jaipur, Rajasthan, published in Infection, Genetics and Evolution. In contrast to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s claim, the authors from NIV clearly state that although no S139N mutations were seen in the tested strains, it cannot be ruled out that the present strains of Zika cannot cause birth defects and large outbreaks and should be treated as such. . Thus, expert opinions and various research data from India and abroad, suggest that the press release that claims that, there are no known microencephaly causing mutations in the virus found in India, is misinformed. This is more dangerous as the perception of this misinformation has been the basis of formatting policy to protect and educate pregnant women travelling in the areas in India where the Zika virus outbreaks have been found. The climate in India is conducive to the transmission of diseases by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito which is responsible to the spread of Zika, especially during the months with rainfall. Two outbreaks of Zika have been detected in India in September-October 2018. There were 154 cases in Rajasthan and 127 cases in Madhya Pradesh. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in USA, had issued a warning and advised pregnant women to avoid travelling to India. However, the Government of India sent a rebuttal to CDC to withdraw or modify this alert as the outbreaks have been contained within small areas. The extent of Zika outbreak and transmission cannot be predetermined since 4 out of 5 individuals infected with Zika do not show any symptoms and can transmit the virus. A surveillance that depends on reported cases will not be able to identify infected persons who do not show symptoms. It is not possible to say the cases were localised since most of the cases are undetected. A 2017 paper by Siraj et al predicts that a Zika epidemic could cause more than 450 million infections in India, more than six-fold of any other country. Hence, more aggressive strategies of diagnosis, surveillance and community mobilization education, especially to pregnant women are needed. Secondly, on one hand, the Government is downplaying the risks of Zika in India, but on the other pregnant women are being advised for abortion. In at least 2 cases, the officials advised Zika infected pregnant mothers to undergo abortion has been reported in DownToEarth . The protocols laid down by WHO for the monitoring Zika infected pregnant women are based on ultrasound and diagnosing for microcephaly. These do not include advice for abortion. As Nathan Grubaugh has commented, clinicians advising for abortions based on Zika infection is unheard of in the rest of the world and is appalling. Thus, the press release by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the mention of lack of ‘known mutations’ for microcephaly is based on misrepresentation of the scientific studies conducted on the genetic material of the virus. It is inconclusive to say that a mutation linked with the most dangerous symptom of the infection, i.e. birth defects of head size, do not exist in the type of Zika virus in India. Moreover, there is not sufficient evidence to say whether the Zika is contained in small areas as mentioned in the rebuttal to the CDC. It is likely that the extent of the outbreak goes undetected since the majority of infections do not exhibit any symptoms. Zika Virus infection is a disease caused by the Zika virus spread mostly by the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. This infection can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her foetus and is dangerous for new-borns as it can result in foetal microcephaly. Foetal microcephaly is characterised by smaller head and brain size and can cause problems such as seizures, developmental delay, difficulty in movement and balance, speech defects and vision defects.

It is likely that the extent of the outbreak goes undetected since the majority of infections do not exhibit any symptoms. The ministry of health and family welfare should responsibly interpret the scientific studies emerging on the Zika virus and take appropriate measures to raise awareness about the disease.",Rohan Gurjar,,,1

The start-up group (Redroom Technology Private...",,"After releasing our 1st investigative report on Sanfe , the co-founder of Redroom, Archit Agarwal sent a copy of the corrigendum published in The Hindu on the 28th of March 2019, accepting that it was a mistake to suggest that Sanfe was FDA approved. However, in the corrigendum, Redroom maintained that the approval was actually from the AYUSH ministry instead. On the phone, Archit Agarwal also maintained that the formula was clinically tested before release, and was safe for use. We contacted the AYUSH ministry, Haryana’s Dr Satish Khatkar, who approved the formulation to determine the authenticity of the certificate of approval by AYUSH. Additionally, we conducted a literature review on the research of different components of the Sanfe roll-on to determine whether it was safe and effective to use as per the claim. Claims: Archit Agarwal clarified that the AYUSH certificate means that Sanfe roll-on is approved by AYUSH Sanfe, consisting of 100% natural oils, causes no side effects. (as per the packaging) It targets the source of pain without having to take ‘pain killers’ (as per the packaging) The claim of approval from AYUSH Both, Redroom Technology and co-founder Archit Agarwal, maintained that the certificate of approval was from the AYUSH ministry, Haryana, and not by the FDA, which was a ’mistake’. When we contacted the authority who had signed this certificate at AYUSH, Dr Satish Khatkar suggested that the document was NOT an approval for safety for the products but only a certificate of approval for manufacturing (see the image of its manufacturing licence). Dr Khatkar from AYUSH, also suggested that the certificate meant those individual components of the product may be effective and safe according to the ancient textbook of Ayurveda, Bhavaprakasha Nighantu (B.P.N), which had not been approved as a combined specific formula that Sanfe roll-on is. Moreover, the certificate or manufacturing licence is given after a confirmatory test by AYUSH that the product has only the individual components as per the claim of the manufacturer and that no other safety tests are conducted by AYUSH. Khatkar also suggested that the responsibility of conducting these safety and toxicity tests was upon the manufacturer, in this case, Space Organics, Haryana. In our previous conversation, the owner of Space Organics, Mr Nagpal, had confirmed that it was not financially viable for them to conduct tests for a product that had a higher research cost than its production cost. Hence, no testing was conducted on this product before its release. After the first Alt News investigative report, Space Organics and Redroom released a document that listed the research on 79 women as per the original claim. This document was not a peer-reviewed published document, did not contain any data, nor it was tested for safety in various conditions. Khatkar suggested that such ‘research’ is likely to be a market survey where a group of women are given the product and later verbally asked to report efficacy. This unsystematic measure of efficacy cannot be considered as clinical research as suggested by the founders of Sanfe. The claim of a safe and natural composition As suggested above, the safety certificate from AYUSH is only for individual components in the roll-on and not for the formula as a whole. As per AYUSH, this safety certificate was backed by the ancient Ayurvedic text Bhavaprakasha Nighantu (B.P.N). Any remedy that affects will, evidently, have unwanted side effects. Hence, the dosage is studied to extract the most desired effect with the maximum tolerable adverse effect. It is false to claim that herbal drugs will be completely free of side effects just because they are ‘natural’. Some of the most potent drugs in medicine have been derived from natural substances which also carry the same adverse effects as any other laboratory synthesized compounds. The use of medicinal plants and oils as a form of topical pain treatment has been widely studied, where detailed adverse effects have been described (Bakkali et al. 2008). Prolonged use of any of the Sanfe’s ‘natural’ ingredients, standalone or in combination, can lead to strong unwanted adverse reactions. Sanfe roll-on consists of 6 components, and there is no prescribed method to limited the frequency of its use. Apart from the described oils (see the manufacturing licence), reportedly, lavender, gandhipura (wintergreen), nilgiri (eucalyptus), rosemary and base oil, the strongest active ingredient is an extract of the mint in the crystal form. While the packaging shown in the image below doesn’t mention crystalline Menthol (mint) as one of the ingredients, the Space Organics certificate above does. Since mint in the herbal form does not contain high quantities of this active ingredient, a crystalline form of the compound menthol is used which can act on the cold receptors in the skin to give pain relief. This is a low-cost compound synthetically manufactured in the lab and is not safe or natural, if not used correctly . Mint essential oil can contain up to 40-90% menthol which is a potent pain killer acting on the cold receptors in the skin. Several topical anesthetics and nasal decongestants such as Vapour-Rubs also contain menthol. Additionally, menthol also enhances the penetration of other transdermal drugs, which means that the absorption of other compounds is increased when mixed with menthol. Drug development companies should issue expert advice on consumption of menthol based compounds as it may be toxic and sub-lethal in higher doses starting from 50-500mg per kg of body weight. The claim of suggesting it as devoid of traditional pain-killers, which target the source of pain. The Sanfe formulation contains several ‘pain killer’ compounds in the form of essential oils that is equivalent (in specific dosage) to over the counter pain killers. For example, an American patent describes a mixture of wintergreen oil, olive oil and/or eucalyptus oil as a topical pain killer. Although Sanfe doesn’t directly claim that its composition has no pain killers, it is contended that pain is reduced without having to take pain killers. Using this roll-on is equivalent to a topical application of consuming a ‘pain killer drug’, provided it gets absorbed into the system in the required dosage. For example, wintergreen oil (8% in Sanfe roll on) contains about 98% of methyl salicylate, a compound closely related to acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin- which is a class of ‘pain killers’. Also, if used excessively, wintergreen oil can lead to toxicity from ingestion of methyl salicylate compound. This toxicity varies for different age groups and is the most harmful in small children. For example, 5 ml of methyl salicylate is equivalent to 5 aspirin tablets (325 mg each). Various toxicity studies have confirmed that while low dose skin application was safe or can cause mild-acute irritation to the skin, dosage over 7 gm for a 70 kg adult can result in severe neurological disturbances (Chin et al. 2007). Other ingredients of Sanfe, such as eucalyptus, lavender, and rosemary have shown limited pain-relieving effects, but have known to cause several skin related, systemic problems and other adverse effects similar to an anaphylactic reaction in higher doses (Darben et al. 1998, Pozadski et al. 2012, Ulbricht et al., 2010). Use of rosemary is also dangerous for anaemics and pregnant women. Lastly, the claim that it penetrates deep into the source of pain is made without understanding the research in pain mechanisms. Pain during menstruation arises deep within the muscles, while this roll-on is applied only on the skin. The muscle and the skin is separated by several other layers of tissue that do not allow deep penetration of topical drugs unless the drug is in systemic circulation through the bloodstream. Hence, the effect of pain relief with Sanfe may be not be attributed through deep absorption through the skin. This claim shows the developers of Sanfe’s meagre understanding of pain emergence during menstruation. Hence, once again, the founders of Sanfe , used government institutes such as AYUSH to promote drugs without any background research or understanding of menstrual pain. Sanfe’ s founders also claimed a to have an approval certificate which, through our investigation, turned out to be a manufacturing licence from AYUSH. The Sanfe formulation is packed with several compounds used as pain-killer medications, as well as other compounds that increase the absorption of such pain-killers, which should be evaluated in toxicity and dosage studies before marketing and administration similar to any other drugs. Thus, under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945, it can be considered as attempts to misbranding the product as defined. The Ministry of AYUSH in a document lists ethical principles to be followed during a clinical trial for Ayurvedic drugs, the launch of the Sanfe product did not seem to follow those guidelines.

Several news outlets such as Indian Express , NDTV , Times of India , The Economic Times , India Today , DNA India , reported as per the Official IIT Delhi website release. As per the archived version of the Sanfe article , reportage by major news outlets as listed above, and during a phone conversation with Sanfe co-founder Archit Agarwal, it was collectively claimed that: It has received ‘FDA approval claiming no side-effects’ It has received an ‘AYUSH ministry certificate of safety’ instead It is developed, medically tested in collaboration with AIIMS Delhi The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), USA, examines and approves a broad range of treatments for medical use including drugs and medical equipment. Although, FDA can approve drugs from international manufacturers, it is to ensure the safety of such products for Americans. FDA approval of treatments is public information. After checking with two online databases here , ( Drugs@FDA and Orange Book ), it was found that Sanfe was not approved by the FDA. A cross-check via email to the Division of Drug Information in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (druginfo@fda.hhs.gov). The FDA CDER confirmed that ‘Sanfe Period Pain Relief Roll-On’ is not a U.S. FDA approved drug product (see screenshot of email response below). When we established our 1 st phone contact with Archit Agarwal, the co-founder of Sanfe, he confirmed that Sanfe doesn’t have the American FDA approval, but actually acquired the approval from FDA, Haryana. During our 2 nd phone contact, also with Archit Agarwal, he suggested they hadn’t acquired any FDA approval but instead had a safety certificate from the AYUSH ministry, Haryana by the manufacturers called Space Organics, Haryana. Upon confronting the reason behind their misleading adverts of FDA approval, he elaborated that the AYUSH certificate was ‘FDA like’ and hence was advertised that way. During our 2 nd phone contact with Archit Agarwal, he claimed that an AYUSH ministry certificate was acquired by the manufacturer Space Organics , Haryana, to determine the safety of the Sanfe roll-on. Thereafter, we contacted the owner of Space Organics Mr Bhupender Nagpal. He stated that his company manufactured Ayurvedic treatments in collaboration with a sister company called Space Life Sciences, led by his son. Mr. Nagpal clarified that neither the FDA approval nor the AYUSH ministry approval exists for the ‘Sanfe roll-on’. The previous version (archived here ) of the Sanfe website, also claimed that it was tested in 79 people in conjunction with AIIMS, Delhi. The owner of Space Organics Mr Bhupender Nagpal who manufactured Sanfe roll-on clarified that no ‘clinical’ or ‘medical’ testing was conducted as a part of safety and toxicity tests. The reason given was that it wasn’t cost-effective for a business to test a product in the market that has a lower purchase value per product in comparison to the cost of the clinical testing. Research databases such as PUBMED also provided no studies referring to the specific Sanfe product. All the claims listed above, i.e. FDA approval, AYUSH ministry safety certificate as well as clinical testing in collaboration with AIIMS, Delhi were not substantiated by the Sanfe founders. Fact-checks from FDA and the Sanfe manufacturers called Space organics also confirmed that the treatment had no official approvals or any ongoing clinical testing.

In Unani, the treatment methods claim to focus on improvement of the bodily functions by removal of unwanted waste and thus, increasing its defence mechanisms. In addition to diet ( Ilaj-Bil-Ghiza ), pharmacotherapy ( Ilaj-Bil-Dawa ), and surgery ( Ilaj-Bil-Yad ), the therapies are regimented and are known as Ila’aj-Bil- Tadbeer which primarily consists of: Fasd : blood-letting using venesection, Ta’areeq : leech therapy, Kai : cauterisation, Hijaama : cupping or suction of skin using cups Amongst the four mentioned above, the cupping therapy or Hijaama is widely used as a form of treatment for both acute and chronic ailments, especially in regions where Unani is the preferred form of treatment over Ayurveda, Siddha or homeopathy. Due to its higher practice by the Unani practitioners over other regimented therapies, people subscribing to Unani medicine are more likely to be adversely affected by cupping than its other physical external therapies. In this article, we will discuss perceptions and falsely attributed claims of Unani and Cupping therapy: The origins of Unani The perception of a prescribed form of treatment in Islam The scientific evidence of efficacy with cupping The risks associated with cupping Conclusion Fact-Check: Unani has ancient Greek, Arabic, Persian, Chinese as well as Indian influences According to Unani, the human body is made up of Arkan (Elements), Mizaj (Temperament), Akhlat (Humours), Aaza (Organs), Arwah (Spirits), Quwa (Faculties or Powers) and Afaal (Functions). Here, Arkan is the four elements such as air, earth, fire and water derived from ancient Indian knowledge ; Akhlat are the four humours of blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile derived from Hippocrates in Greece ; and Arwah is the gaseous spirit ( Ruh ) that burns the Akhlat (Humours) to produce all kinds of Quwa (natural, psychic and vital powers) for a healthy function of the body- derived from the ancient Arabic wisdom. Thus, the developed form of Unani after the 13th century in the Indian-subcontinent consisted of ancient Indian, Greek and Arabic knowledge of medicine. Hippocrates (or Buqrat, 460BC- 370BC) , the father of medicine from ancient Greece (Yunan), planted the idea for a rational and physical cause for diseases. Later, Greek physicians during the Roman period such as Galen (or Jalinoos, 129AD-200AD) developed it further. In the 4th century AD, the Greek medicine spread throughout Syria and was carried by the Nestorians into Persia, where it became available to the Islamic World . Later, it also derived knowledge from ancient China, where the exchange of Chinese herbs between 8th-13th century influenced Unani practice . Hence, originating in ancient Greece or Yunan, Unani was developed from the teachings of philosophers such as Greek Hippocrates and Galen, Avicenna (Ibn Sina ) and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi of ancient Persia, Chinese herbalists, and much later in India, by Hakim Abdul Hameed and Syed Zillur Rahman of India . Fact-Check: Unani, that is practised currently in India, had not been completely developed during the life of the Prophet. Also, it is likely that the Prophet may have recommended cupping through Islamic texts, not as a preferred treatment, but because it may be the only major treatment available at that period of time. The ancient Egyptian texts suggest the existence of Unani practices such as Hijaama or cupping predating (1550 BC) the life of the Prophet. Thus, it was prevalent and possibly the only form of treatment before, during and much after the life the Prophet. Also, the mention of cupping is nowhere in the Qur’an but in ‘Hadiths’ that ‘strengthen’ each other . Hence, it is plausible, that the Prophet may have referred to it as a treatment method. The form of Unani practised currently in India and the Indian subcontinent is merely a reflection of the journey it has undergone and the knowledge it has accumulated from the ancient Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Chinese and the traditional Indian systems of healing. Therefore, it is likely to be a variant from the primitive form of Unani practised during the life of the Prophet. Hence, alluding Unani and its therapies such as ‘Cupping’ as the prescribed form of medicine in Islam may be only partially true. Cupping therapy (CT) Cupping is a method used for local evacuation/diversion of humours using cups attached to the surface of the skin which creates negative pressure. Cupping can be dry, with fire, or ‘wet’ – with small incisions to draw out blood. On the website of the Ministry of AYUSH , it is suggested that cupping can be used for Cleaning the skin of waste matters. To stop excessive menses or epistaxis. To correct liver diseases. To treat malaria and spleen disorders. To treat piles, inflammation of testes and uterus, scabies, boils etc. Using the modern knowledge of physiology, cupping is justified as a means to help supposedly helps with pain, inflammation, blood flow and provides deep-tissue massage by relaxing them. There is no scientific evidence that cupping therapy can prevent bleeding, correct liver and spleen diseases, treat malaria or any other infections or treat inflammation. By using sheer negative force or pulling of the skin, cupping may remove external, dry skin scabs but it may not be the safest or effective method to remove scabs. Several research studies have reported elaborate benefits of cupping therapy. A recent review article by researchers in Saudi Arabia collated studies that highlighted these benefits as “Reported effects of cupping therapy include promotion of the skin’s blood flow, changing of the skin’s biomechanical properties, increasing pain thresholds , improving local anaerobic metabolism , reducing inflammation, and modulation of the cellular immune system .” However, systematically reviewing the studies suggest that these studies contain highly biased conclusions. 3.1. Claim: Cupping increases blood flow Fact-Check: While it is true that the pressure due to cupping increases blood flow to the surface and changes skin’s biomechanical properties . There is no evidence that these effects can be beneficial in the short term over the local injury, inflammation or burns the therapy is known to cause. 3.2. Claim: Cupping improves anaerobic metabolism, reducing inflammation and modulation of the immune system and thereby, reducing illnesses Fact-Check: Increasing anaerobic metabolism may lead to an increase in metabolic acidosis (body accumulating excessive amounts of acid) which can cause an increase in pain. The study suggesting reduced inflammation after cupping measured a change in plasma cortisol level (a hormonal marker for stress and low blood glucose), which is a variable throughout the day and is manipulated by several other factors such as food intake. There is no evidence in that study that cortisol is manipulated by cupping only. Also, the study that linked modulation of the immune system measured a change in WBC (white blood cells), which is also indicates infection or inflammation. Hence, none of the above changes suggests that they could be used as an indicator of health improvement, but increases in WBC can be a function of immune system problems such as infections. 3.3. Claim: Cupping reduces chronic pain Fact-Check: Several studies ( Chi et al. 2016 , Kim et al. 2012 & many more) have suggested that cupping therapy can reduce long-lasting chronic pain. Pain is a subjective experience and is highly modulated by the patient’s expectations of treatments . Hence alternative therapies show significant efficacy in pain conditions, many of which are effective by placebo analgesia . Since, the studies indicating a positive effect on pain lack any form of blinding from the patient’s part, it is highly likely that those effects may have been due to raised expectations. Additionally, these studies have a low sample size, high bias for a positive result and lack of international standards of research. These studies lack the scientific credibility to suggest cupping may have had a mechanistic effect on chronic pain. More systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses ( Cao et al. 2012 , Cao et al 2010 , & Lee et al. 2011 ) also indicate that cupping therapy has no evidence whatsoever in treating chronic illnesses. Fact-Check: While experts claim that cupping therapy has no adverse reactions, several side-effects such as viral infections, local injury, inflammation and pain due to bruising have been reported. Kim et al. 2014 reported from 16 studies conducted in Korea that linked anaemia (due to blood loss in wet cupping), local tissue injury (due to suction pressure), and herpes viral infection (due to skin lacerations in wet cupping). Another study reported the possibility of a haemorrhagic stroke due to elevated blood pressure in the cervical area. In cases of cupping with heat or fire, several burn injuries are prevalent with some requiring hospitalisation and skin grafting due to burns. The understanding of the human body is perpetually updating with novel information. It is counterproductive to use ancient medical practice that is maladaptive in the modern context. It is more dangerous to do so when those practices are entrenched in religious belief systems. The treatment system of Unani and its treatment of cupping is one such example. It is possible that the Prophet may have recommended it (as suggested by Hadiths) being the only form of modern medical practice during the life of the Prophet, but it is dangerous to suggest that it is the only prescribed form in Islam. This attribution can make more people relying inclusively on it without understanding the mechanism of its efficacy. The ministry of AYUSH observed the ‘Unani day’ on the 11th of February 2019 to raise awareness for the Unani branch of alternative medicine (alt-med) in India. In the AYUSH acronym, Unani represents the ‘U’ and ostensibly, an equal branch of the AYUSH systems. However, AYUSH heavily promotes other branches such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Homeopathy or Siddha, more than Unani. The countdown begins! 50 days to go for Unani Day celebrations.

Moreover, the specific practice of cupping has no clinical evidence as a treatment method for any of the claims made by AYUSH or the research literature. The studies that concluded with positive results had a ‘high bias’ risk, included limited sample size, conducted with no degree of blindness, were without international research standards, and hence lacked credibility.

Ayurvedic Physicians have been treating malaria since ancient times.

Considering its wide prevalence and developing drug resistance to malaria parasite, CCRAS has developed a polyherbal non-toxic, anti-malarial drug through extensive pharmacological, toxicological and clinical studies. This has been named AYUSH- 64. (Always consult a physician if symptoms of malaria are noticed) ” The above text roughly suggests that Ayurvedic practitioners have been treating malaria since ancient times, where causes, development of the disease, symptoms as well as treatments are described in detail in the classic Ayurvedic text of Vishamajvara. Since, malaria is widely prevalent and its commonly used treatment drugs are often subjected to resistance, i.e. the disease-causing organism that renders the drug ineffective, CCRAS has developed a drug to counter malaria. This drug is made of several herbs, is non-toxic and is claimed to have been researched extensively for its efficacy, toxicity and through its testing in clinical patients with malaria. This drug is called AYUSH-64. In this article, we will discuss: Malaria infection: Its symptoms, prevention and treatment The new anti-malarial drug by CCRAS: AYUSH-64 The claims by CCRAS on the drug AYUSH-64 The evidence for efficacy for AYUSH-64 Misinformation on AYUSH-64 and other anti-malaria treatments on the internet and mainstream media Conclusion Malaria continues to be one of India’s leading public health problems. India is among the top 15 countries that accounted for 80% of global malaria deaths in 2016. Malaria, a life-threatening disease, is caused by a one-celled parasite called “ Plasmodium ”. The parasites spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. These mosquitoes generally bite at the night time- between dawn and dusk. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these – Plasmodium falciparum ( P.falciparum ) and Plasmodium vivax ( P.vivax ) – pose the greatest threat. Symptoms: A person having malaria infection may have recurrent attacks of symptoms like shaking chills, high fever, sweating. Other signs may include headache, vomiting or diarrhoea. Generally, these symptoms may be confused with other viral infections too, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Malaria is one of the world’s top killer diseases for young children, because they have not yet developed immunity against it. Prevention : Some of the main strategies to prevent mosquito bite include use of mosquito repellent creams, coils, mats etc; use of bed nets and wearing full sleeve clothes. Treatment: Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and Chloroquine are the recommended drugs for treating malaria patients. The WHO also recommends preventive anti-malarial medicines for susceptible people living in endemic areas, like Odisha and the north-eastern parts of India. Although malaria vaccine development has seen considerable progress and trials are ongoing, currently there is none available that can provide complete protection against malaria. Ayush-64 was developed and patented by CCRAS in India around 38 years ago. It is a combination of 4 Ayurvedic products: Alstonia scholaris (aqueous bark extract), Picrorhiza kurroa (aqueous rhizome extract), Swertia chirata (aqueous extract of whole plant) and Caesalpinia crista (fine-powdered seed pulp). Recently, CCRAS has licensed with Dabur for the manufacturing and commercialisation of AYUSH-64. CCRAS claims to have conducted several uncontrolled and controlled field trials in collaboration with the Malaria Epidemic Control Program in the 1980’s and 1995 for testing Ayush-64. They report to have treated 3,600 and 10,000 P.vivax cases with this drug at Rajasthan and Assam. However, we did not find any scientific peer-reviewed research article on GoogleScholar/Pubmed sites, supporting their claim on the efficacy and number of patients. Alt News found very few published studies on Ayush-64 and concluded that the anti-malarial claim was backed by very scant, flawed and outdated scientific evidence. CCRAS had earlier conducted a study on AYUSH-64 in 1981 . They had tested the response on 55 malaria positive cases. Although they reported 80% response with the drug, there were several major inadequacies in their study: Lack of Controls and Standards: This was an uncontrolled study with no mention of whether it was randomised or blinded, which makes us believe that it was neither. Also, the treatment response was not compared with any standard anti-malarial drug. Effect studied for a short duration: The drug’s response was followed up for only three, six or nine days. Additionally, the patients who responded after three or six days were never followed up later. Since relapse is common in malaria, it is possible that some patients may have shown resurgence of the infection after initial clearance. However, such cases would have been misinterpreted here as “cured”. Unaccounted Parasite Counts: The parasite counts were not measured and accounted for analysis. Hence, there could be highly variable initial parasite counts among the patients, which could have directly affected their response. Longer response time in mixed infections: Many of the patients with mixed infections of the two strains ( P.vivax and P.falciparum ) showed a much longer response time of up to nine days with the AYUSH drug. This kind of study does not meet the current standards of field or clinical trials. Additionally, as the susceptibility of the parasite keeps changing, this study is outdated and is irrelevant in the current scenario. The current director of NIMR (National Institute of Malaria Research), Dr. Neena Valecha, had also published her findings on AYUSH-64 in a peer-reviewed journal, Current Science. Her study demonstrated that AYUSH-64 was not a promising primary anti-malarial drug. Contradictory to the CCRAS study, this was a more structured and comparative study. In this phase II randomised controlled trial, the patients were followed up for 28 days. The cure rate with AYUSH-64 was found to be less that 50% as compared to 100% with the standard drug. Considering poor efficacy of the drug and risk of complications, the authors had even suggested against its testing for the more severe P.falciparum species. We also searched the National Clinical Trials Registry of India (established in 2007) for AYUSH-64 and found no data on the drug, implying that no recent trial has been initiated or conducted for the drug. AYUSH-64 has been reported as a wonder drug for malaria in an article published by Hindu . Another article in TheHansIndia had also reported that AYUSH-64 is highly effective against malaria. Articles claiming the effectiveness of such herbal products spread false information, as the suggested products or drugs have not undergone significant clinical testing and consuming them could in fact worsen the patient’s condition. As drug resistant malaria cases are rising, there is a need to develop newer treatment options. The therapeutic possibilities of various plants/extracts are being explored. However, consuming such herbal parts/plants may not give the required response, due to variation in dosage. So, their use over time could result in increased incidence and resistance of malaria cases. As an example, the WHO recommends using Artemisinin (a plant derived compound) in combination with other drugs, as an effective anti-malarial strategy. However, it does not recommend consuming the plant from which this drug is derived, in any form, either for prevention or cure of malaria. They explain that such plant derivatives, may be unstable and present in lesser and variable doses than required for a pharmacological response. Several websites and videos on Youtube suggesting misleading alternative therapies for malaria are available on the internet. Interestingly, some of these website s have also cautioned about their usage. One such disclaimer reads: “ Caution with Ayurveda Treatment: Ayurvedic remedies can probably treat malaria effectively, but inform your physician if you intend to use herbal remedies. Do not rely on Ayurvedic remedies for the prevention of malaria or treatment of severe malaria. Ayurvedic remedies should probably be used for malaria treatment till you reach a proper medical facility. ” As the risk of ineffectively treating malaria could be fatal, the available information should be interpreted carefully to choose the right treatment option. AYUSH-64, developed by CCRAS, is going to be marketed by Dabur India Ltd, as an effective anti-malarial drug. However, there are very few, faulty and outdated scientific studies which have tested the efficacy of the drug. Most of these have major limitations like no controls, inadequate follow up time, less sample size and no normalisation of baseline parasite levels. Moreover, most of them are published by CCRAS in their self-owned low-impact journals, further questioning their credibility. Besides, another independent study published in a reputed scientific journal, provides contradictory evidence refuting the CCRAS claims. Also, malaria is commonly caused by two different parasite species, but this drug’s response has been studied mainly with one species ( P.vivax ). Altogether, it’s completely unscientific and irrational to market AYUSH-64 as an effective anti-malarial drug without proper clinical studies. The CCRAS (Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences), an autonomous body of the Ministry of AYUSH, has developed an Ayurvedic formulation, AYUSH-64, that claims to treat malaria without side effects. Although developed 38 years ago, the scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of this drug remains scant. Despite this, the NRDC (National Research Development Corporation) has signed an agreement with Dabur to market this drug in 2014. Recently, the Ministry of AYUSH promoted this drug on their Facebook and Twitter accounts. A Facebook post of Ministry of AYUSH reads: “Malaria is one of the most destructive disease conditions known to mankind. Ayurvedic Physicians have been treating malaria since ancient times.

Although they reported 80% response with the drug, there were several major inadequacies in their study: Lack of Controls and Standards: This was an uncontrolled study with no mention of whether it was randomised or blinded, which makes us believe that it was neither. Also, the treatment response was not compared with any standard anti-malarial drug. Effect studied for a short duration: The drug’s response was followed up for only three, six or nine days. Additionally, the patients who responded after three or six days were never followed up later. Since relapse is common in malaria, it is possible that some patients may have shown resurgence of the infection after initial clearance. However, such cases would have been misinterpreted here as “cured”. Unaccounted Parasite Counts: The parasite counts were not measured and accounted for analysis. Hence, there could be highly variable initial parasite counts among the patients, which could have directly affected their response. Longer response time in mixed infections: Many of the patients with mixed infections of the two strains (P.vivax and P.falciparum) showed a much longer response time of up to nine days with the AYUSH drug. This kind of study does not meet the current standards of field or clinical trials. Additionally, as the susceptibility of the parasite keeps changing, this study is outdated and is irrelevant in the current scenario. Study 2: The current director of NIMR (National Institute of Malaria Research), Dr. Neena Valecha, had also published her findings on AYUSH-64 in a peer-reviewed journal, Current Science. Her study demonstrated that AYUSH-64 was not a promising primary anti-malarial drug. Contradictory to the CCRAS study, this was a more structured and comparative study. In this phase II randomised controlled trial, the patients were followed up for 28 days. The cure rate with AYUSH-64 was found to be less that 50% as compared to 100% with the standard drug. Considering poor efficacy of the drug and risk of complications, the authors had even suggested against its testing for the more severe P.falciparum species. We also searched the National Clinical Trials Registry of India (established in 2007) for AYUSH-64 and found no data on the drug, implying that no recent trial has been initiated or conducted for the drug. Misinformation on AYUSH-64 and other anti-malarial treatments on the internet and media AYUSH-64 has been reported as a wonder drug for malaria in an article published by Hindu. Another article in TheHansIndia had also reported that AYUSH-64 is highly effective against malaria. Articles claiming the effectiveness of such herbal products spread false information, as the suggested products or drugs have not undergone significant clinical testing and consuming them could in fact worsen the patient’s condition. As drug resistant malaria cases are rising, there is a need to develop newer treatment options. The therapeutic possibilities of various plants/extracts are being explored. However, consuming such herbal parts/plants may not give the required response, due to variation in dosage. So, their use over time could result in increased incidence and resistance of malaria cases. As an example, the WHO recommends using Artemisinin (a plant derived compound) in combination with other drugs, as an effective anti-malarial strategy. However, it does not recommend consuming the plant from which this drug is derived, in any form, either for prevention or cure of malaria. They explain that such plant derivatives, may be unstable and present in lesser and variable doses than required for a pharmacological response. Several websites and videos on Youtube suggesting misleading alternative therapies for malaria are available on the internet. Interestingly, some of these websites have also cautioned about their usage. One such disclaimer reads: “Caution with Ayurveda Treatment: Ayurvedic remedies can probably treat malaria effectively, but inform your physician if you intend to use herbal remedies. Do not rely on Ayurvedic remedies for the prevention of malaria or treatment of severe malaria. Ayurvedic remedies should probably be used for malaria treatment till you reach a proper medical facility.” Conclusion As the risk of ineffectively treating malaria could be fatal, the available information should be interpreted carefully to choose the right treatment option. AYUSH-64, developed by CCRAS, is going to be marketed by Dabur India Ltd, as an effective anti-malarial drug. However, there are very few, faulty and outdated scientific studies which have tested the efficacy of the drug. Most of these have major limitations like no controls, inadequate follow up time, less sample size and no normalisation of baseline parasite levels. Moreover, most of them are published by CCRAS in their self-owned low-impact journals, further questioning their credibility. Besides, another independent study published in a reputed scientific journal, provides contradictory evidence refuting the CCRAS claims. Also, malaria is commonly caused by two different parasite species, but this drug’s response has been studied mainly with one species (P.vivax). Altogether, it’s completely unscientific and irrational to market AYUSH-64 as an effective anti-malarial drug without proper clinical studies. The common perception for both herbal and Ayurvedic drugs is that they are safe and without side effects. However, consuming such medicines with very low and limited efficacy, especially for a complicated disease like malaria, would do more harm than good. The disease if not completely cured can show increased relapse, resistance and continued transmission of the parasite. Further, malaria eradication program in India may get stalled if such medicines are brought into market under a popular brand like Dabur.",Shivani Mittal,,,1

The magnets are attached to the body with the help of adhesives or worn in the form of jewellery like bracelets or necklaces. Depending on prescription, the magnets can be worn for a varied length i.e. for a few minutes to days or even weeks depending upon the site of the application and the therapists’ prerogative. On the website of AYUSH , it is stated that, “ Magnet therapy is a clinical system in which human ailments are treated and cured through the application of magnets to the body of the patients. ” In this article, we will discuss: The three claims by which magnet therapy is known to work, and Large scale meta-analyses to evaluate the benefit of magnet therapy Conclusion Those who practise magnet therapy argue that some tissues and cells emit electromagnetic impulses, and that illness and/or injury disrupt these electromagnetic impulses. It is claimed by proponents of magnet therapy that these disruptions can be restored by the use of magnets, thus treating the ailment. Magnet therapy is claimed to treat diseases such as headaches including migraines, arthritis, and stress-related pain can be relieved. Iron is a major component of red blood cells (RBCs). Iron in these cells are contained in a metal-protein complex called haemoglobin, which temporarily bind with oxygen molecules in the lungs, circulate in the body, and ‘detach’ in the rest of the body sites such as muscles. The RBCs lacking oxygen then return to the lungs via the heart. These RBCs flow in the circulatory systems with veins and arteries, for blood lacking oxygen (de-oxygenated) and containing oxygen (oxygenated) respectively. Since, iron is known to attract itself to magnets, it is hypothesised that iron in the blood will also act in a similar way. A study published in 1936 in the Proceedings from the National Academy of Sciences , on the magnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin concluded that the iron in blood is not ferromagnetic. Also, the study stated that while oxygenated blood and plasma are diamagnetic, and may actually slightly repel a magnet so there would be no physiological effect of an external magnet; non-oxygenated blood is weakly paramagnetic which attracts slightly to a magnet. However, blood flows in a high pressure and turbulence to have no effect of a permanent magnet on its flow. Hence, magnet therapy cannot have a measurable effect on blood flow. A study by Mayrovitz and colleagues showed that there was no difference in blood flow on skin when compared in a group of healthy people in which magnet was placed in one hand and a sham (no magnet) was placed in another hand. The measurement of skin blood perfusion by a method called laser Doppler flowmetry and imaging showed no significant differences in the blood flow of either hands. Hence, there is no evidence to support the claim of increased blood flow to the areas where permanent magnets are applied. The principle of oxygen loss and gain in the blood is used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices. MRI uses the blood oxygenated status to reveal detailed bodily structures, in particular the brain and the spinal cord. But an MRI machine does not produce a magnetic effect of repellence or attraction on human bodies, only to metal objects attached onto them. Additionally, while the magnetic field produced in MRI machines is relatively high, permanent magnets used in magnet therapies are very weak to even penetrate the skin and influence the flow of blood. For example , a standard small sized magnet can be of 0.001 Tesla/ 10 Gauss (unit of measurement for magnetic field), while a standard MRI machine starts from 1.5 Tesla/ 15000 Gauss. Stick C and his group studied the impact of strong magnetic fields emanating from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) systems, used for medical imaging as well as to depict molecular structures of organic compounds. They used 0.4T to 1T (Tesla) to apply on a small area on the body and concluded that at such high strengths, no effect was found in the local blood flow to the thumb or forearm. Another technique, called trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) also uses two magnetic coils to produce excitatory or inhibitory changes, specifically at a single point, in the neural tissue such as the brain. In this method, repeated bursts of high intensity magnetic stimulation are often delivered at the rate of 1 Hz (one burst per sec), to modulate a local region in the tissue. However, the intensity of TMS therapy is as high as 1.5T to 2T (similar to MRI machines) delivered repeatedly over a short period of time. Hence, high dose magnetic strength is unable to influence blood flow or oxygen flow to tissues where it has been applied. Also, TMS is limited to stimulation of neural tissues or cells that are excitable. This claim that magnet therapy for 45 mins can abolish pain perception emerged from a 1997 study, led by Vallbona and colleagues. The study showed beneficial effects in a small group of patients, however, the results remained controversial due to the use of a small subject number (n=50). The study was never replicated in a larger group and hence, the effect was proved scientifically unsubstantial. In another study published by Brown and colleagues in 2002 , it was concluded that chronic pelvic pain reduced after wearing active magnets for 4 weeks, however, due to the subjects’ awareness of the therapy, the lack of ‘blinding’ may have impacted on the change in pain perception. The patients receiving active magnets were more likely to guess that they had received the active therapy instead of a sham magnet. This knowledge of therapy clearly creates a bias in the patients mind and contributes to a ‘placebo effect’. Since pain perception is subjective and largely reliant on pain expectations, it can be easily manipulated by placebo treatments. Also, such methodologies where, subjects are not appropriately blinded for therapies, goes against the principles of scientific testing. Large-scale meta-analysis research studies that show magnet therapy is ineffective Meta-analyses are those in which a group of similar studies are taken together and the data is pooled to have a larger sample size to better evaluate the efficacy of a treatment. 1. A 2007 meta-analysis study by Pittler and colleagues, showed that magnets did not improve pain as compared to a placebo in patients of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, low-back pain, plantar heel pain and foot pain. In the osteoarthritis groups, the positive effects were visible, however, the evidence was not insufficient. This insufficient evidence related to magnetic therapy use in osteoarthritis was also shown in 2012 by Macfarlane in another systematic review. 2. Another study published in 2007 by Cepeda and colleagues showed that magnetic therapy lacked efficacy in decreasing pain or opioid requirements following surgery. A carpel tunnel syndrome pain study showed no benefits of magnet therapy. In this study, the researchers made sure the magnets and shams (fake magnets) were boxed separately to avoid compromising the study. Surprisingly, both magnet and the sham receiving group showed improvement but both had no statistical difference between them showing that psychological placebo effect plays a huge role in such treatments. The ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy), Govt. of India recently promoted Magnet therapy on their twitter handle ‘@moayush’ as part of the promotions of Naturopathy Day (Prakritik Chikitsa Divas) in India on November 18.

Magnet therapy is claimed to treat diseases such as headaches including migraines, arthritis, and stress-related pain can be relieved.

Hence, there is no evidence to support the claim of increased blood flow to the areas where permanent magnets are applied. Claim 2: Increasing the magnetic field strength increases the penetration of the field into the skin and hence the overall effect on blood flow The principle of oxygen loss and gain in the blood is used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices. MRI uses the blood oxygenated status to reveal detailed bodily structures, in particular the brain and the spinal cord. But an MRI machine does not produce a magnetic effect of repellence or attraction on human bodies, only to metal objects attached onto them.

Hence, high dose magnetic strength is unable to influence blood flow or oxygen flow to tissues where it has been applied. Also, TMS is limited to stimulation of neural tissues or cells that are excitable. Claim 3: Magnet therapy can provide pain relief. This claim that magnet therapy for 45 mins can abolish pain perception emerged from a 1997 study, led by Vallbona and colleagues. The study showed beneficial effects in a small group of patients, however, the results remained controversial due to the use of a small subject number (n=50).

Surprisingly, both magnet and the sham receiving group showed improvement but both had no statistical difference between them showing that psychological placebo effect plays a huge role in such treatments. Conclusion: The low field strength of permanent small magnets used in magnetic therapies and inability of blood to be ferromagnetic, small body magnets may not have any appreciable effect on blood flow. There is also no evidence of strong magnets like MRI, which easily penetrate the skin and enter deep lying organs, of producing any effect on blood flow. Pain relief studies conclude that such studies do not account for double blinding. Since pain is a highly subjective sensation, patient expectations, due to belief in a certain therapy, can hugely modulate pain perception. Lastly, large meta-analysis and studies conducted with patient blinding, concluded that magnet therapy was ineffective in various pain conditions.",Nikhil Bardeskar,,,1
https://www.altnews.in/fact-check-dr-dixits-two-meals-a-day-diet-for-weight-loss-diabetes/,Fact-check: Dr. Dixit’s ‘Two meals a day’ diet for weight-loss & diabetes,https://i0.wp.com/www.altnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/jagannat-dixit.jpg?resize=300%2C157&ssl=1,2018-12-26 15:02:09,2018-12-26 15:02:09,"On 20th Nov 2018, The Times of India published an article titled- ‘Two-meals-a-day’ professor to drive diabetes fight. The article quoted Dr. Jagannath Dixit who stated that, “If one follows...",,"“If one follows the two meal (a day) practice, I am sure there will not only be weight loss, but it will also help in controlling diabetes. Reversal of diabetes is also possible.” Dr. Dixit is the appointed brand ambassador for tackling obesity and diabetes by the medical education department of Govt. of Maharashtra. BJP leader Girish Mahajan, who heads the medical education department, stated that ‘the reason to appoint Dr. Dixit as the brand ambassador was that his ‘diet plan’ to tackle obesity and diabetes is yielding results.’ Dr. Dixit has popularized this notion of ‘two meals a day’ by several videos on Youtube, with the most popular video with 1.6M views , as well as viral content on social media, spread largely through WhatsApp groups. Dr. Dixit claims that having only 2 meals a day, each lasting less than 55 mins, leads to significant weight loss of around 8kg in 3 months. As per Dr. Dixit, reducing the frequency of food intake, regardless of the quantity or the quality of the food, can have an impact on the insulin level. In his Marathi video below, he has also claimed that this method can potentially reverse the pre-diabetic conditions. The link between obesity and diabetes The recommendations for weight loss in diabetic patients Dr. Dixit’s theory related to ‘two meals a day’ Whether these claims are based on existing research by Dr. Dixit Conclusion and hazards of the misinformation Diabetes and obesity have emerged as the biggest health challenges in India. Calorie intake (though eating) in excess of consumption (exercise), which is then converted into excessive fat that can lead to obesity. Obesity, a surplus of energy in cells, in turn leads to insulin resistance , a condition where glucose uptake is impaired. This impairment in glucose uptake leads to higher glucose in blood terms as diabetes. Insulin resistance is the primary cause of type 2 diabetes and it occurs well before type 2 diabetes starts in humans. In addition to food intake, exercise and other lifestyle factors, genetics play a huge role in determining the risk of obesity and diabetes. While, over 90% of diabetic patients fall in this category called Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, there are several other variants of Diabetes such as type 1 with different pathophysiological mechanisms. Calorie restriction, Small frequent meals, Regular exercises, and Anti-hyperglycaemic drugs may be prescribed by specialist diabetes physicians, to maintain a basal blood glucose. Large rapid changes in blood glucose in diabetic patients can be hazardous and patients must maintain optimal glucose in the meal by controlling the frequency, quality and quantity of their diet. These recommendations are based on published data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, i.e. a collective evaluation of several RCTs to increase sample size (patient numbers). Claim 1: Food intake should be no more than 55 mins long to avoid the second bout of insulin Dr. Dixit’s argument is that if one continues to eat for more than 55 minutes, a second bout of insulin (in equal amount) would be released. In addition to a low amount of continuous insulin release, insulin is released in two phases in healthy humans in larger quantities. Phase I, soon after starting the meal and, phase II, about 45 to 60 mins after the consumption of a meal. Any meal would trigger the two phases of insulin release, in proportion to the quality of the meal. However, in type 2 diabetes patients, the first phase of insulin release is impaired which produces the inability to process glucose after meals leading to postprandial hyperglycaemia. Since, the insulin release varies with food intake, it is false to claim that limiting food intake time to 55 mins can stop the phase II insulin release. Claim 2: Quantity and quality of food is irrelevant to insulin release Dr. Dixit’s claim that ‘a fixed amount of insulin is released in response to every meal irrespective of quantity and quality of meal’. In his english video, he also elaborated that even eating sweets is permissible even for diabetic patients if they follow the two meal a day diet plan. On the contrary, numerous publications with well-designed studies suggested that the insulin response is proportional to the amount of food and correlated with carbohydrate content of the food. That is, larger quantities of food releases larger doses of insulin. Food insulin index (FII), the amount of insulin released in response to a meal as against the reference food (bread), for various meal compositions has been studied and published in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . The study showed that, when insulin level was measured in healthy people, who consumed 13 different meals with the same energy content, it strongly correlated with the insulin demand predicted by FII of the component foods. This means that, quantity and quality both, has a huge impact on the amount of insulin released, which negates the second and most dangerous claim. Claim 3: Two meals, anytime during the day, can reduce weight and possibly control diabetes Dr. Dixit suggested in his popular video , that having two meals anytime during the day, even as late as at 9 pm in the evening, can help with obesity and diabetes. We examined two contradictory studies to understand and fact-check Dr. Dixit’s statements. A study , published in 2014 in Diabetologia , with 27 type-2 diabetic patients in each group, tested this effect that compared 2 large meals which were consumed earlier in the day (e.g. lunch and breakfast) vs. 6 small meals throughout the day, and concluded that there was a significant difference in body weight and fasting plasma glucose among others. However, according to a study published in the journal ‘ Diabetes Care ’, two meals can lead to a significantly higher insulin response as compared to multiple meals. In 12 diabetic patients, two large meals produced greater increase in glucose and insulin release than 6 small meals, provided that the caloric consumption in two large meals were the same as six small meals. This means, that while Dr. Dixit may not be entirely wrong in suggesting the two meal a day plan. However, suggesting that the timing of the two meals are irrelevant for obesity and diabetes is factually incorrect. Also, there is far greater evidence, in reliable journals, that suggests that, if the total components of the meals are of the same calorific value, i.e. iso-caloric diets, smaller-regular meals are far better for obesity and diabetes than larger-infrequent meals. We conducted a scientific literature review on claims made by Mr. Girish Mahajan, the BJP leader, and Dr. Dixit using Google, Google scholar and PUBMED. On all portals we could not find any research in the area of obesity or diabetes with their names. However, from Dr. Dixit’s speeches, we found two articles published in a non-indexed journal called International Journal of Clinical Trials . Study 1 : This study has little scientific value as the parameters such as weight and waist size were not accurately measured by a researcher using calibrated equipment and instead were taken over the phone from the patient (self-reported). Study 2 : This was a preventive study in pre-diabetic patients with a sample size of 48. The results showed that HbA1C, (a parameter to measure overall glycemic load) decreased by 0.8% after 3 months of treatment. In this study, in addition to two meals a day in pre-diabetic patients, the subjects were advised to go for a 45-minute brisk walk, 5 days a week. However, another meta-analysis study of 20 randomised control trials have shown that HbA1C (maximum 0.78%) can be reduced by regular exercise alone. We could not find any published research to substantiate his claim with regards to limiting the meal time to 55 minutes and as a result, the subsequent avoidance of the 2 nd phase insulin release. The claims of Dr. Dixit that amount of insulin released in response to meals has no relation with the quality and quantity of meals is factually incorrect, and is in stark contrast to the physiological facts established via numerous published studies. While according to one study, two meals earlier in the day had an impact on body weight and plasma glucose, the benefits were not extended to other time periods such as late evening meals as suggested by Dr. Dixit. The larger body of established evidence suggest it is beneficial to consume smaller meals of low calories throughout the day as opposed to two large meals, leaving the subject open for further research in a larger cohort of patients. In particular, Dr. Dixit made a dangerous claim in the initial part of the video that diabetes patients can consume sweets as long as they stick to the two-meal diet, but later suggested that it is preferable to have more proteins instead. Dr. Dixit is associated with a social media campaign related to diabetes and obesity. The majority of case studies and experiments conducted by him are based on self-testing or self-reported measures and cannot be taken as scientific evidence. Hence, Dr. Dixit’s viral claim is not only misinformed but is potentially harmful for the pre-diabetic and type-2 diabetes patients for following reasons. The patients with type 2 diabetes who are on glucose lowering drugs are at a very high risk of hypo-glycaemia, which can cause light-headedness and shivering, if they do not take frequent meals as advised by the doctor. Consuming limitless food in one go would lead to consumption of excessive calories, especially if the patients opt for high caloric food and would in turn lead to weight gain. On 20th Nov 2018, The Times of India published an article titled- ‘Two-meals-a-day’ professor to drive diabetes fight. The article quoted Dr. Jagannath Dixit who stated that, “If one follows the two meal (a day) practice, I am sure there will not only be weight loss, but it will also help in controlling diabetes.

Phase I, soon after starting the meal and, phase II, about 45 to 60 mins after the consumption of a meal. Any meal would trigger the two phases of insulin release, in proportion to the quality of the meal. However, in type 2 diabetes patients, the first phase of insulin release is impaired which produces the inability to process glucose after meals leading to postprandial hyperglycaemia. Since, the insulin release varies with food intake, it is false to claim that limiting food intake time to 55 mins can stop the phase II insulin release. Claim 2: Quantity and quality of food is irrelevant to insulin release Dr. Dixit’s claim that ‘a fixed amount of insulin is released in response to every meal irrespective of quantity and quality of meal’. In his english video, he also elaborated that even eating sweets is permissible even for diabetic patients if they follow the two meal a day diet plan. On the contrary, numerous publications with well-designed studies suggested that the insulin response is proportional to the amount of food and correlated with carbohydrate content of the food. That is, larger quantities of food releases larger doses of insulin. Food insulin index (FII), the amount of insulin released in response to a meal as against the reference food (bread), for various meal compositions has been studied and published in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study showed that, when insulin level was measured in healthy people, who consumed 13 different meals with the same energy content, it strongly correlated with the insulin demand predicted by FII of the component foods. This means that, quantity and quality both, has a huge impact on the amount of insulin released, which negates the second and most dangerous claim. Claim 3: Two meals, anytime during the day, can reduce weight and possibly control diabetes Dr. Dixit suggested in his popular video, that having two meals anytime during the day, even as late as at 9 pm in the evening, can help with obesity and diabetes. We examined two contradictory studies to understand and fact-check Dr. Dixit’s statements. A study, published in 2014 in Diabetologia, with 27 type-2 diabetic patients in each group, tested this effect that compared 2 large meals which were consumed earlier in the day (e.g. lunch and breakfast) vs. 6 small meals throughout the day, and concluded that there was a significant difference in body weight and fasting plasma glucose among others. However, according to a study published in the journal ‘Diabetes Care’, two meals can lead to a significantly higher insulin response as compared to multiple meals. In 12 diabetic patients, two large meals produced greater increase in glucose and insulin release than 6 small meals, provided that the caloric consumption in two large meals were the same as six small meals. This means, that while Dr. Dixit may not be entirely wrong in suggesting the two meal a day plan. However, suggesting that the timing of the two meals are irrelevant for obesity and diabetes is factually incorrect. Also, there is far greater evidence, in reliable journals, that suggests that, if the total components of the meals are of the same calorific value, i.e. iso-caloric diets, smaller-regular meals are far better for obesity and diabetes than larger-infrequent meals. We fact-checked if Dr. Dixit has published any research to support his claims? We conducted a scientific literature review on claims made by Mr. Girish Mahajan, the BJP leader, and Dr. Dixit using Google, Google scholar and PUBMED. On all portals we could not find any research in the area of obesity or diabetes with their names. However, from Dr. Dixit’s speeches, we found two articles published in a non-indexed journal called International Journal of Clinical Trials. Study 1: This study has little scientific value as the parameters such as weight and waist size were not accurately measured by a researcher using calibrated equipment and instead were taken over the phone from the patient (self-reported). Study 2: This was a preventive study in pre-diabetic patients with a sample size of 48. The results showed that HbA1C, (a parameter to measure overall glycemic load) decreased by 0.8% after 3 months of treatment. In this study, in addition to two meals a day in pre-diabetic patients, the subjects were advised to go for a 45-minute brisk walk, 5 days a week. However, another meta-analysis study of 20 randomised control trials have shown that HbA1C (maximum 0.78%) can be reduced by regular exercise alone. Conclusion: We could not find any published research to substantiate his claim with regards to limiting the meal time to 55 minutes and as a result, the subsequent avoidance of the 2nd phase insulin release. The claims of Dr. Dixit that amount of insulin released in response to meals has no relation with the quality and quantity of meals is factually incorrect, and is in stark contrast to the physiological facts established via numerous published studies. While according to one study, two meals earlier in the day had an impact on body weight and plasma glucose, the benefits were not extended to other time periods such as late evening meals as suggested by Dr. Dixit. The larger body of established evidence suggest it is beneficial to consume smaller meals of low calories throughout the day as opposed to two large meals, leaving the subject open for further research in a larger cohort of patients. In particular, Dr. Dixit made a dangerous claim in the initial part of the video that diabetes patients can consume sweets as long as they stick to the two-meal diet, but later suggested that it is preferable to have more proteins instead. Dr. Dixit is associated with a social media campaign related to diabetes and obesity. The majority of case studies and experiments conducted by him are based on self-testing or self-reported measures and cannot be taken as scientific evidence. Hence, Dr. Dixit’s viral claim is not only misinformed but is potentially harmful for the pre-diabetic and type-2 diabetes patients for following reasons. The patients with type 2 diabetes who are on glucose lowering drugs are at a very high risk of hypo-glycaemia, which can cause light-headedness and shivering, if they do not take frequent meals as advised by the doctor. Consuming limitless food in one go would lead to consumption of excessive calories, especially if the patients opt for high caloric food and would in turn lead to weight gain.

He had even suggested that the Supreme Court order should be enforced with the assistance of military . I am happy that SC has decided that gender equality in worship is to be followed in Sabarimalai. This what I had been advocating — Subramanian Swamy (@Swamy39) September 28, 2018 Thereafter, Dr Swamy changed his position on the Sabarimala issue and suggested that the supreme court should reconsider its verdict. In the course of this article, we will examine Dr Swamy’s scientific claim that a unique ‘gravitational matrix’ within the Sabarimala temple may be a cause of genetic mutations in women thereby impacting their health. Dr Swamy claims that there is something called as ‘gravitational matrix’ which is a distinct form of gravitational force only present in the Sabarimala Temple. Many theories including that of Newton and Einstein have tried to explain gravitation – the phenomenon that attracts everything with mass and energy to one another. Matrix theory of gravitation is one such proposed theory which is identical to what Einstein estimated. Gravity is the force of attraction that pins us to Earth and prevents us from floating off our roughly spherical planet. This force of gravity throughout the land’s surface on Earth is largely the same, at least perceptually. Due to changes in ground altitude from the sea level across the Earth’s land surfaces, there may be a small variation in the gravitational forces. This is because gravity changes as we go further away or higher in altitude from the sea level on Earth. NASA and the European space agency map have extremely sensitive accelerometers that have mapped out the gravitational field of Earth with over 3 billion points. With this form of high resolution, there were differences of gravitation measured by the gravitational acceleration (standard g= 9.80665 m/s 2 ), i.e. the speed gained by an object in a free fall due to gravity. For example, Mount Nevado Huascarán in Peru has the lowest gravitational acceleration, at 9.7639 m/s 2 , while the highest is at the surface of the Arctic Ocean, at 9.8337 m/s 2 . As opposed to the minimal or lack of gravity in space, this difference due to uneven landmasses on Earth is just 0.7% and has no impact on any complex living organism such as humans. Our body’s entire set of genetic material is called our genome- which is packed in smaller bundles called chromosomes. Our chromosomes reside in the nucleus of our cells that carry the genetic information (or genes) for growth, development and other bodily functions. This genetic material (genotype) is largely inherited and determines physical attributes (phenotype) such as height, skin colour or eye colour of a newborn. These genes are made of several molecules of DNA which can be broken or changed due to a mutation. However, there are other ways to change this genetic material. While mutations are permanent changes to genetic material that can occur at random, either during replication of genes, which is an ongoing process of new cell formation and growth, external influences can such as prolonged exposure to chemicals or UV light can also cause mutations. While most of these mutations are harmless, and can be automatically ‘fixed’ by your body’s internal mechanism, a small fraction of them can be either injurious or beneficial to humans. For example, certain mutations can provide resistance to HIV , while others can often cause many diseases, for example skin cancer or melanoma caused due to prolonged sun exposure that can cause mutations in the melanin pigment producing cells int he skin. Even if there was some mutation causing factor (mutagen) at Sabarimala temple complex, it cannot selectively and precisely cause mutation only in women between the age of 10-50 and spare the rest of female and male devotees, just like the sun’s UV rays. Like most bodily functions there is a lot of variability in menstruation. The age of menarche (start of menstruation) and menopause (end of menstruation) often goes beyond the range of 10-50. Women regularly and naturally start menstruation as young as 9 years old and continue having it, often beyond the age of 50 . With respect to menstruation or fertility, the age segment doesn’t seem to be justified. Even so, small changes in gravitation has no impact on menstruating women’s bodies, unless they are in space, which is more of a logistical issue in hygiene. Studies on women astronauts have shown that even large gravitational changes such as a spaceflight had no impact on women’s reproductive health or fertility. For reference, the international space station in the Earth’s orbit in the space has about 90% of the Earth’s gravity. This is about 9-10% change in gravitational force and impacts neither genders’ fertility, except the supportive tissues such as muscles and bones. Hence, it is unlikely for any smaller gravitational change on Earth to cause any short- or long-term physiological damage, or even so, in a particular gender or age-group. On 19 October, 2018, Dr Subramanian Swamy, a Rajya Sabha MP nominated by BJP, sent out a series of tweets justifying the demand that women should not be allowed to enter Sabarimala. The arguments to support this ban have emerged from the ancient notion that menstrual blood is impure. Dr Swamy’s contention was that the women should not be allowed inside the temple due to health reasons. He claimed that “admission of women in menstruation period in Sabarimalai was to protect the women from mutation from gravitational matrix“. He further claimed the during the menstruation period, “the gravitational matrix in the said temple can affect pregnancy“.

And the best part is you can make it at home. The juice of the humble papaya leaf has been seen to arrest the destruction of platelets that has been the cause for so many deaths this dengue season. Ayurveda researchers have found that enzymes in the papaya leaf can fight a host of viral infections, not just dengue, and can help regenerate platelets and white blood cells.” The idea to elevate platelet count in dengue patients using papaya plants has been commercialised in a tablet form called ‘Caripill’ which comprises of papaya leaf extract. There are research studies, largely with dubious statistics & problematic blinding, to suggest how this drug may be helpful in increasing the lowered platelet count, a symptom of dengue fever that may cause bleeding. As the course of the disease is about 10 days, the studies claim that it increases platelets about 2 days earlier as compared to no other treatment. However, the social media post fails to mention that even if the drug may be slightly effective in increasing the platelet count, it is not an indication of recovery from the dengue infection itself. Moreover, the studies do not measure the effects of ‘Caripill’ in those patients where platelet count is at dangerous low (i.e. in extremes forms of dengue) or compared the data with patients who received transfusion therapy. The studies do not measure the changes in dengue viral load or the extend of symptoms such as fever or rashes, which are the real indicators of recovery. With large errors bars in the research data, it is likely that this drug is effective in only in some patients, not all, and is not devoid of producing adverse effects as projected. What is a dengue infection? Misinformation on dengue and papaya Criticism from experts on the ‘Caripill’ papaya drug marketed for dengue Is elevating platelet count a pathway to recovery? Analysis of research studies on Caripill for dengue infection & Conclusion Dengue fever is an infection caused by viruses of Flaviviridae family that use mosquitoes as its host organism. The mosquito ( Aedes aegypti ) gets the virus by biting an infected person which later spreads to other healthy humans. The first symptom of the disease appears in about 4-5 days after the bite, and includes high fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting and body rashes, besides joint or muscle pain. Although, it is not usually life threatening; it is a painful and debilitating condition. Dengue virus has four different serotypes or subspecies (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4). Although each infection provides lifelong immunity to that specific serotype, a subsequent infection at a later stage with a different serotype increases the risk of a more extreme version of a disease called dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The data from National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NCVBDCP, India) suggested that in 2017, the number of cases increased over 4 times as compared to 2014. Although infrequent, dengue infection killed 325 people in 2017, as opposed to 137 in 2014. There is incomplete data for 2018 but dengue infection rate has surged again this year, suggesting the epidemic is recurrent and here to stay. Every year, during the months in which dengue is most widespread, posts about papaya, papaya leaves or papaya seeds as a cure for the disease crowd the social media ecosystems in various Asian, African and South American countries including India. A Facebook video about Papaya seeds being a cure for all things viral, including dengue, has over 13 million views. Similarly, there are dozens of such videos on Youtube with one having over a million views. Yet another post of a box of Carica papaya leaves tablet called ‘Caripill’ has been recirculated on social media with the following caption: “Caripill Tablet is primarily made from papaya leaf extract to treat dengue. It raises the platelet count in patients and aids in the recovery from the disease.” Micro Labs: Caripill Tablet is primarily made from papaya leaf extract to treat dengue. It raises the platelet count in patients and aids in the recovery from the disease. https://t.co/6MoycON20O #FEVER #disease #treatment #Dengue #denguefever #Medicines #tablet #TamilNadu #India pic.twitter.com/h6Pd3mbBPs — JOAN LOUIS 👮🇮🇳 (@joanlouis14) October 26, 2018 The National Health Portal of India , the official government website for public health information, also stated that although there is no specific treatment for dengue, medicinal plants such as guduchi, tulasi, dried ginger and papaya prevents complications and helps to control the disease faster. Previously, several media houses such as The Hindu and Times of India have reported that not only the tablet of papaya leaves, but the consumption of ripe papaya juice or the consumption of papaya leaves by boiling or crushing can cure dengue by raising platelet counts in blood. Last year, an article in the New Indian Express reported criticism from Dr. Srinivas Kakkilaya, consultant physician, Spandana Centre for Metabolic Medicine, Mangaluru, of the social media post shared by Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Health Secretary of the Department of Health and Family Welfare, titled ‘Remedy for Dengue’ with an image of onions and jaggery. “There is no mention of the word ‘virus’ in Charaka Samhita. When something does not even recognise the infection, how can they recommend remedy? ” Thereafter, the Department of AYUSH issued a statement that said, “It is not intended to suggest that these remedies should be used instead of conventional treatment.” Bangalore based pharmaceutical company Micro Labs, who are the manufacturer of Caripill, also claim that the drug has been approved by the Department of AYUSH in May 2015. Dr. Hiten Kareliya , an infectious disease expert, suggested that “dengue acts by penetrating deep into the tissues including the bone marrow (site of platelet production), where, through a mechanism of immune compliment activation, platelet counts are reduced. It only becomes crucial to raise platelet count when they are hazardously low (through transfusion). However, that does not mean the recovery is attained from the viral infection.” This suggests that while every patient requires monitoring of platelets, it is not required of every dengue patient to undergo therapy to counteract reduced platelets. And doing so, does not mean one is treating the dengue infection itself. Dr. Kareliya further added, “Change in platelet count is an indicator of immune function. There can be patients with weak or suppressed immunity, such as very young or old patients, with a dengue infection but with no major change in platelet counts, hence, the Caripill papaya drug may have a weak effect on platelet counts, but that does not reduce the viral infection itself.” This suggests that the dengue virus works in reducing the platelet count according to the immune response of the individual. For immuno-compromised individuals, the dengue infection might persist without any major changes in blood tests. It also means that in a large number of patients, low platelets may not be an indicator of infection but dengue viral load is. Also, he stated that, “From the total number of patients visiting his clinic due to an existing dengue infection, about 20-30% of the patients are already consuming the drug” This means that these patients have existing uncured dengue infection as well as symptoms of dengue despite consuming ‘Caripill’ drug. Preventative measures from mosquito bites are of utmost importance, especially to prevent recurrent infections. Treatments for dengue symptoms such as painkillers or fluid therapy is recommended, while the infection can take its clinical course and can recover on its own within 10 days. While the social media posts suggests consumption of papaya plant in various forms such as the fruit, seeds and its leaves, the research conducted on dengue patients to observe platelets were limited to drugs made from papaya leaves. We found two clinical trials in PUBMED in which human studies were conducted, both in July 2016, and both in the same journal (The Journal of Association of Physicians of India) that correlated the effect of papaya extract with a fast recovery of dengue fever on the basis of reduced platelet count. Study 1: Gadhwal, A. K., Ankit, B. S., Chahar, C., Tantia, P., Sirohi, P., & Agrawal, R. P. (2016). Effect of Carica papaya leaf extract capsule on platelet count in patients of dengue fever with thrombocytopenia . J Assoc Physicians India , 64 (6), 22-6. In the results section, authors from this study stated that “papaya leaf extract capsule raised the platelet count by 3rd day with decreased requirement of platelet transfusion”. However, we replotted the data given in the article result section with its Mean SEM (standard error of the mean), given for two groups, i.e. papaya leaf drug vs control placebo drug given to a about 400 and 200 dengue patients respectively. We found serious interpretation problems in this study. In the graph shown above, on most days except one timepoint (at 96 hrs), error bars overlap each other and hence, no significant differences can be observed between patients receiving papaya drug vs. control group. On the day with largest differences between control and papaya group (96 hrs post from the first dose), we can see that the error bars still overlap one another. But since, the sample size is large (n = 400 dengue patients), it can be concluded that the treatment effects are very weak. Most importantly, the study was not blinded, which means that expectations of drug performance from the patients and health practitioners can hugely impact the results. The statement by the ministry of AYUSH and study 1 claims there are no side effects with the papaya extract drug. But while carefully reading study 1, it quotes other observations that suggests, while a dose up to 0.25 g to 0.5 g/Kg body weight is considered safe, higher doses can lead to side effects such as rash, itching, pain abdomen, nausea and vomiting. These side effects are the very debilitating side effects of dengue fever that patients are trying to recover from. Study 2: Kasture, P. N., Nagabhushan, K. H., & Kumar, A. (2016). A multi-centric, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized, prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Carica papaya leaf extract, as empirical therapy for thrombocytopenia associated with dengue fever. J Assoc Physicians India , 64 (6), 15-20. The 2nd study, however, was conducted using double blinded methods, which means that drug expectations may not have impacted the result. These results were similar to study 1, where at 96 hr timepoint post drug administration, platelet count shows signs of recovery with papaya drug. However, error bars overlapped at all timepoints suggesting a very weak effect. That is, the variation from the average result at the peak of its effectiveness (i.e. highest platelet count) was statistically similar to the adjacent days with lower result. Also, in both cases, the error bars suggested that both studies may have some (not all) patients who had significantly faster platelet recovery with papaya drug, but a large majority didn’t. As the immune system of each individual is different, the drop of platelet count can vary accordingly. Therefore, varying platelet counts should be normalized as percentage change from the baseline to show robust changes across cohort. Additionally, weak effects, studies lacking patient blinding to the drug, and dubious statistics in the experiment suggests that it needs more research in different conditions to conclude Caripill as an effective drug to increase platelets. A normal recovery pattern of dengue infection (clinical course) as shown in figure above has the same timeline as the two studies showing papaya drug and control groups. Moreover, there is no mention of what the loss or gain of platelets means in terms of clinical symptoms within the 8-10 day’s course of dengue infection, which means the studies do not show if the symptoms such as fever or pain are reduced because of Caripill. Also, there is no data that suggests that the viral load or viraemia (see figure above) is reduced due to the papaya drug, which is the real indicator of drug efficacy. With the surge in dengue cases this year, a 2012 Facebook post with an image of papaya leaves is viral again with close to 995,000 shares since it was first posted. This Facebook post attributes a Times of India article as the source of information, and suggests that the juice of papaya leaves may be a miracle cure for dengue. “It could be a miracle cure for dengue. And the best part is you can make it at home. The juice of the humble papaya leaf has been seen to arrest the destruction of platelets that has been the cause for so many deaths this dengue season. Ayurveda researchers have found that enzymes in the papaya leaf can fight a host of viral infections, not just dengue, and can help regenerate platelets and white blood cells.” Overview The idea to elevate platelet count in dengue patients using papaya plants has been commercialised in a tablet form called ‘Caripill’ which comprises of papaya leaf extract.

The data from National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NCVBDCP, India) suggested that in 2017, the number of cases increased over 4 times as compared to 2014. Although infrequent, dengue infection killed 325 people in 2017, as opposed to 137 in 2014. There is incomplete data for 2018 but dengue infection rate has surged again this year, suggesting the epidemic is recurrent and here to stay. Misinformation on dengue and papaya Every year, during the months in which dengue is most widespread, posts about papaya, papaya leaves or papaya seeds as a cure for the disease crowd the social media ecosystems in various Asian, African and South American countries including India. A Facebook video about Papaya seeds being a cure for all things viral, including dengue, has over 13 million views. Similarly, there are dozens of such videos on Youtube with one having over a million views. Yet another post of a box of Carica papaya leaves tablet called ‘Caripill’ has been recirculated on social media with the following caption: “Caripill Tablet is primarily made from papaya leaf extract to treat dengue. It raises the platelet count in patients and aids in the recovery from the disease.” Micro Labs: Caripill Tablet is primarily made from papaya leaf extract to treat dengue. It raises the platelet count in patients and aids in the recovery from the disease.https://t.co/6MoycON20O#FEVER #disease #treatment #Dengue#denguefever #Medicines #tablet #TamilNadu #India pic.twitter.com/h6Pd3mbBPs — JOAN LOUIS 👮🇮🇳 (@joanlouis14) October 26, 2018 The National Health Portal of India, the official government website for public health information, also stated that although there is no specific treatment for dengue, medicinal plants such as guduchi, tulasi, dried ginger and papaya prevents complications and helps to control the disease faster. Previously, several media houses such as The Hindu and Times of India have reported that not only the tablet of papaya leaves, but the consumption of ripe papaya juice or the consumption of papaya leaves by boiling or crushing can cure dengue by raising platelet counts in blood. Criticism from experts on the ‘Caripill’ papaya drug marketed for dengue Last year, an article in the New Indian Express reported criticism from Dr. Srinivas Kakkilaya, consultant physician, Spandana Centre for Metabolic Medicine, Mangaluru, of the social media post shared by Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Health Secretary of the Department of Health and Family Welfare, titled ‘Remedy for Dengue’ with an image of onions and jaggery. “There is no mention of the word ‘virus’ in Charaka Samhita. When something does not even recognise the infection, how can they recommend remedy?” Thereafter, the Department of AYUSH issued a statement that said, “It is not intended to suggest that these remedies should be used instead of conventional treatment.” Bangalore based pharmaceutical company Micro Labs, who are the manufacturer of Caripill, also claim that the drug has been approved by the Department of AYUSH in May 2015. Is elevating platelet count a pathway to recovery? Dr. Hiten Kareliya, an infectious disease expert, suggested that “dengue acts by penetrating deep into the tissues including the bone marrow (site of platelet production), where, through a mechanism of immune compliment activation, platelet counts are reduced. It only becomes crucial to raise platelet count when they are hazardously low (through transfusion). However, that does not mean the recovery is attained from the viral infection.” This suggests that while every patient requires monitoring of platelets, it is not required of every dengue patient to undergo therapy to counteract reduced platelets. And doing so, does not mean one is treating the dengue infection itself. Dr. Kareliya further added, “Change in platelet count is an indicator of immune function. There can be patients with weak or suppressed immunity, such as very young or old patients, with a dengue infection but with no major change in platelet counts, hence, the Caripill papaya drug may have a weak effect on platelet counts, but that does not reduce the viral infection itself.” This suggests that the dengue virus works in reducing the platelet count according to the immune response of the individual. For immuno-compromised individuals, the dengue infection might persist without any major changes in blood tests. It also means that in a large number of patients, low platelets may not be an indicator of infection but dengue viral load is. Also, he stated that, “From the total number of patients visiting his clinic due to an existing dengue infection, about 20-30% of the patients are already consuming the drug” This means that these patients have existing uncured dengue infection as well as symptoms of dengue despite consuming ‘Caripill’ drug. Preventative measures from mosquito bites are of utmost importance, especially to prevent recurrent infections. Treatments for dengue symptoms such as painkillers or fluid therapy is recommended, while the infection can take its clinical course and can recover on its own within 10 days. What does the research say on Caripill for dengue infection? While the social media posts suggests consumption of papaya plant in various forms such as the fruit, seeds and its leaves, the research conducted on dengue patients to observe platelets were limited to drugs made from papaya leaves. We found two clinical trials in PUBMED in which human studies were conducted, both in July 2016, and both in the same journal (The Journal of Association of Physicians of India) that correlated the effect of papaya extract with a fast recovery of dengue fever on the basis of reduced platelet count. Study 1: Gadhwal, A. K., Ankit, B. S., Chahar, C., Tantia, P., Sirohi, P., & Agrawal, R. P. (2016). Effect of Carica papaya leaf extract capsule on platelet count in patients of dengue fever with thrombocytopenia. J Assoc Physicians India, 64(6), 22-6. In the results section, authors from this study stated that “papaya leaf extract capsule raised the platelet count by 3rd day with decreased requirement of platelet transfusion”. However, we replotted the data given in the article result section with its Mean SEM (standard error of the mean), given for two groups, i.e. papaya leaf drug vs control placebo drug given to a about 400 and 200 dengue patients respectively. We found serious interpretation problems in this study. In the graph shown above, on most days except one timepoint (at 96 hrs), error bars overlap each other and hence, no significant differences can be observed between patients receiving papaya drug vs. control group. On the day with largest differences between control and papaya group (96 hrs post from the first dose), we can see that the error bars still overlap one another. But since, the sample size is large (n = 400 dengue patients), it can be concluded that the treatment effects are very weak. Most importantly, the study was not blinded, which means that expectations of drug performance from the patients and health practitioners can hugely impact the results. The statement by the ministry of AYUSH and study 1 claims there are no side effects with the papaya extract drug. But while carefully reading study 1, it quotes other observations that suggests, while a dose up to 0.25 g to 0.5 g/Kg body weight is considered safe, higher doses can lead to side effects such as rash, itching, pain abdomen, nausea and vomiting. These side effects are the very debilitating side effects of dengue fever that patients are trying to recover from. Study 2: Kasture, P. N., Nagabhushan, K. H., & Kumar, A. (2016). A multi-centric, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized, prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Carica papaya leaf extract, as empirical therapy for thrombocytopenia associated with dengue fever. J Assoc Physicians India, 64(6), 15-20. The 2nd study, however, was conducted using double blinded methods, which means that drug expectations may not have impacted the result. These results were similar to study 1, where at 96 hr timepoint post drug administration, platelet count shows signs of recovery with papaya drug. However, error bars overlapped at all timepoints suggesting a very weak effect. That is, the variation from the average result at the peak of its effectiveness (i.e. highest platelet count) was statistically similar to the adjacent days with lower result. Also, in both cases, the error bars suggested that both studies may have some (not all) patients who had significantly faster platelet recovery with papaya drug, but a large majority didn’t. Conclusion As the immune system of each individual is different, the drop of platelet count can vary accordingly. Therefore, varying platelet counts should be normalized as percentage change from the baseline to show robust changes across cohort. Additionally, weak effects, studies lacking patient blinding to the drug, and dubious statistics in the experiment suggests that it needs more research in different conditions to conclude Caripill as an effective drug to increase platelets. A normal recovery pattern of dengue infection (clinical course) as shown in figure above has the same timeline as the two studies showing papaya drug and control groups. Moreover, there is no mention of what the loss or gain of platelets means in terms of clinical symptoms within the 8-10 day’s course of dengue infection, which means the studies do not show if the symptoms such as fever or pain are reduced because of Caripill. Also, there is no data that suggests that the viral load or viraemia (see figure above) is reduced due to the papaya drug, which is the real indicator of drug efficacy. Hence, it is highly likely that dengue patients are returning to normal health with no treatments. That is, similar to other non-life-threatening viral infections, patients’ innate immune system develops antibodies against dengue serotypes without external interventions. Even if Caripill influences increasing platelets, it does not reflect on the recovery of the dengue symptoms or protect from getting dengue hemorrhagic fever.",Dr. Sumaiya Shaikh,,False,1

This country wide program, started in February 7, 2017 to go until April...",,"However, there have been several social media rumours circulated against this vaccine, particularly on WhatsApp, suggesting falsely, that it contains anti-fertility agents to sterilise their children, or worse, can cause their deaths. These rumours are targeted at parents of young children and evoke fear in them causing them to shun this program. There are multiple versions of this rumour. One version is targeted particularly at the Muslim community, calling it “slow poison”, “a government conspiracy” or “an RSS plan”. Rumour 1 : “ *Very very Important msg* Newly invented injection for Smallpox treatment *MR – VAC*. *But actually it is not true.* This medicine has been band in many countries. Now this MNC are sending this injection through this Modi government to all schools to inject all children compulsory. Please educate your children, not to take this injections at any cost. It is slow poison which will affect the future of the child as well as future generations also.” Rumour 2 : “ Dear brothers and sisters assalamualikum all the schools have decided to give an injection for your childrens all over india so dear brothers dont let your children’s get that injection object that in your child’s school it’s an RSS plan in which your children when they will turn around 40 they wont be able to have thier kid one teacher in kerla have told taht this injection should put to Muslim children’s only so kindly do not let them get this injection for your children’s safety. ” These rumours were re-fueled recently when 4 deaths were reported in Gujarat, 30 to 115 hours after vaccination, in addition to 14 similar incidences of children’s death in 21 states where the MR vaccination drive was carried. These rumours are still in circulation despite the central investigating team ruling out any linkage between these deaths and MR vaccines. The team leader of the health officials from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW), Dr. Haldar, commented that these deaths were due to other medical conditions and not due to the MR vaccine. In this article, we will discuss: The measles-rubella (MR) disease & its vaccine constituents, How effective are the MR vaccines in preventing diseases? People who can and cannot get the MR vaccine The rumours & side effects of MR vaccine, & The benefits of MR vaccine as well as the ill-effects of avoiding vaccination Measles : It is a severe disease, often complicated by middle-ear infection or bronchopneumonia and can be a major cause of illness and death. Encephalitis (brain inflammation) occurs in approximately one of every 2000 reported cases that can lead to permanent brain damage and mental retardation. Death, from respiratory and neurological problems, occurs in 1 per 3000 reported measles cases. The risk of death is greater for infants and adults, than for children and adolescents. Rubella: Rubella virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the nose, throat and the local lymph nodes. In the blood, its presence occurs 5-7 days after exposure and then spreads to different organs. Symptoms can be transient rash, joint pain and arthritis. Infection in early pregnancy leads to congenital rubella syndrome which may result in multiple fetal defects in up to 90% of cases, affecting many organs which often results in miscarriage or stillbirth. Infants who survive after congenital rubella syndrome can face major developmental disabilities. Vaccine: A number of live, attenuated vaccines for measles and rubella are available such as combination measles-rubella vaccine (MR) or, in combination with mumps vaccine (MMR). The vaccine is generally injected subcutaneously, although intramuscular administration has also been shown to be extremely effective. The virus in the vaccine is live but with reduced virulence and is harmless in healthy humans. These MR vaccines in India are courtesy of Serum Institute of India . In addition to the weakened viruses, these vaccines may contain ingredients required during the manufacturing and production . These include emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives and adjuvants and have also been deemed as completely safe by WHO and other regulatory bodies. From studies conducted in highly vaccinated American schools , one dose of measles vaccine administered at 12 months or more was approximately 94% effective in preventing measles, and was ≥99% in two studies with 2 doses of measles vaccine. Measles outbreaks among populations that have received 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine are uncommon. Age can impact the effectiveness: In an epidemiological study , the 85% vaccine effectiveness represented children vaccinated at age 12 months, whereas the ≥94% vaccine effectiveness represented children vaccinated at age ≥15 months Two doses are better than one : Studies found the incremental effectiveness of 2 doses was 89% and 94%, compared with 1 dose of measles vaccine. Outbreaks of rubella in populations vaccinated with the rubella RA 27/3 vaccine strains are rare. Available studies demonstrate that vaccines containing the rubella RA 27/3 strain are approximately 97% effective in preventing clinical disease after a single dose. Although MR vaccine is safe and available for every child between 9 months- 15 years in the 2018 vaccination program in India, the optimal age for MR vaccination is between 12-15 months. However, people should not be vaccinated if they have any of the following : Known allergies to MR vaccine, or antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of MMR vaccine: Allergies can be of any form and the cause can be anything from grass, pollen or peanuts. Vaccination should not be given in the event of a known allergy from a previous experience of MR vaccination or neomycin. if in doubt, a patch test or an intradermal test can confirm the existence of an allergy. The allergic symptoms, such as dermatitis or anaphylaxis can be treated immediately, by oral or topical corticosteroids, or by an epinephrine autoinjector, e.g. Epipen Pregnant women: Women should avoid pregnancy for at least a month after getting the MR vaccine and get it after they are no longer pregnant. Cancer or other diseases that weakens immune system AIDS or HIV infection that renders patients immuno-compromised Medical treatments such as radiation, immunotherapy, steroids, or chemotherapy also reduces immunity Immediate relative who has a history of immune system problems such as a parent, a brother, or a sister A history of condition that makes them bruise or bleed easily A recent history of blood transfusion or recipient of other blood products. Advisable to postpone MR vaccination for a period of more than 3 months Tuberculosis infection A recent history of other live vaccines in the past 4 weeks The MR vaccine is safe and effective at preventing measles, and rubella. Although, vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects but getting the vaccine is much safer than getting measles, or rubella. Most people who get MR vaccine do not have any serious and long-term problems with it. Contrary to the claim in the rumour above, there is no known link between MR vaccine and mass-sterilization. Contrary to several other rumours linking autism and MR vaccine, there is no evidence of this link between vaccine and autism. Several studies have reported and published as primary data as well as in the form of systematic reviews of other published data . Also, the original research article by Wakefield claiming this cause-effect relationship was retracted for being fraudulent which was reported by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 2011 . Some side effects of the vaccine can be sore arm from the shot, fever, mild rash, temporary pain and stiffness in the joints. A review of scientific literature, case studies and statistics on adverse reactions to vaccines reported that immune thrombocytopenic purpura (decreased blood platelets) and febrile seizures with fever, can be a rare side effect emerging from MMR (measles, mumps & rubella) vaccine. This decrease in blood platelets is rare and not life-threatening. It is temporary and usually goes away without treatment. The approximate rate of occurrence is 1 per 20,000 doses. The febrile seizures are also rare and are not associated with any long-term effects. The approximate rate of occurrence is even smaller at < 1 per 1,000,000 doses. Also, the risk of febrile seizures increases as child get older and hence, it is recommended that they get vaccinated as early as possible. In extremely rare cases, a child may have a serious allergic reaction to MR vaccine. Hence, it is recommended that those who have had known life-threatening allergic reactions to the antibiotic neomycin, or any other components of MR vaccine, should not be vaccinated. The overall risk of any side effects were calculated in a systematic review of 186 eligible studies on MMR vaccinations published in ‘Medicine’ journal in 2015. It reported that, in incidences of any adverse events, only about one-tenth of the events were considered to be related to vaccination studied. And about half of the related events were febrile seizures (that have no long-term effects). The incidence of related febrile seizure was under 0.8‰ in MMRV (mumps, measles, rubella, varicella) groups. Vaccination will protect your child as well as others from measles & rubella When you are vaccinating your child, you are not just protecting your child but also others in the community. Infections travel a lot faster in the community (person-person) which can lead to an epidemic. By vaccinating, you are avoiding this rapid spread by which an entire community can prevent the infection. Subsequently, you are protecting people, especially young children, from getting infected who cannot or have not vaccinated yet. For example, in large joint families or day-care centres, where children of all ages come in contact with each other, babies younger than 12-15 months old who have not been vaccinated yet, can get infected even if one child or adult has not been vaccinated. In such babies, such infections are often very serious and life threatening. Hence, babies are the most vulnerable and 100% community vaccination protects them via the immunity of playmates, parents or extended joint families, and this immunity is called ‘ herd immunity’ . Contrarily, even if older children are vaccinated, younger babies will always possess a risk due to non-vaccinated individuals coming in contact with the baby. Contrary to the claim in the rumour above, there is no known link between MR vaccine and mass-sterilization in a particular religious community as the same vaccine is given to other religious communities. Common mistakes such as believing in rumours about sterilisation, autism and deaths associated with MR vaccination include assuming a causal relationship based on a temporal association of affected patients. Factors fueling these rumours include lack of trust in the government and health care workers, timing during which autism is detected -which is around the same time as a large number of children get vaccinated, as well as vulnerability of babies who can be prone to infections or deaths in that age group. Such infections or deaths are a correlation but not a causation as the central investigation report had identified. Both, the benefits of vaccination and the ill effects from not taking it, are many. A similar anti-vaccination campaign , in a form of a rumour for polio vaccine, was prevalent in Nigeria in the 2003-2004, which sustained for 15 months, where, due to the lack of trust in the military, Nigerian parents did not get their children vaccinated. The rumour also suggested that the polio vaccine had anti-fertility agents that resulted in the subsequent boycott of the vaccine. We are still seeing the long-term ill effects in Nigeria as it is the only African country where polio has mass-prevalence. Currently, Nigeria accounts for 86% of the polio cases in the African continent . Health rumours have the potential to fuel an epidemic, also called a ‘ misinfodemic’ and affect several people very rapidly, the only way to protect is to immunize through vaccinations and discerning false information from the truth. For further information on measles and rubella vaccines morbidity and mortality, refer to the scientific report by the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . The government of India, in collaboration with UNICEF, have initiated a vaccination drive for measles-rubella (MR) vaccine. This country wide program, started in February 7, 2017 to go until April 2019, has targeted to achieve 410 million children vaccinated (aged between 9 months-15 years), and has covered 17 states. The program is currently running in Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab and, Andaman & Nicobar Islands. However, there have been several social media rumours circulated against this vaccine, particularly on WhatsApp, suggesting falsely, that it contains anti-fertility agents to sterilise their children, or worse, can cause their deaths. These rumours are targeted at parents of young children and evoke fear in them causing them to shun this program. There are multiple versions of this rumour.

It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021 , which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch . However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed on a black stone is viral on social media. It is claimed that this stone was found in Afghanistan. Viral messages claim that though the stone is cool from the outside, it can melt anything made of steel and iron when placed in contact. Twitter user @kabirkhan488 shared the clip with the same claim.

In this article, we will look at some of these tweets (quoted verbatim in italics) and discuss the scientific evidence on symptoms, myths, causes and treatments of clinical depression. “Depression is a kind of agony. If you have become agony and not ecstasy, it is because a large part of your life energy is happening compulsively, not consciously. It is happening as a reaction to external situations.” ( tweet ) “Depression means you are committing suicide in installments.” ( tweet ) A’kin to other chronic illnesses, depression can feel agonizing but it is beyond a patient’s control to replace agony with ecstasy, or, as it was implied, shift one’s negative emotional state to a positive state. WHO acknowledges that depression is the most common mental health disability. It can be as debilitating as any physical disability. Everyday actions such as going to work, or, even getting out of bed for the day, can be an effort. The symptoms of depression vary on the severity of the condition: while mild depression has some impact on life and counselling therapy can help with it, severe depression makes it much harder to deal with everyday activity and can exhibit psychosis like symptoms with a larger physical component such as delusions, hallucinations, lack of self-awareness, changes in the brain structures, etc. Mr. Vasudev’s tweet on suicide was plain insensitive and false. While depression can cause suicide, not all suicide cases are due to depression and not all depressive patients commit, or have the tendency to commit, suicide. Lastly, depression can be of several types and there are conditions such as post-partum depression, bipolar disorder and seasonal affective disorder, where depression is one of the symptoms, not the disease itself. “The main cause of depression in the world today is too much eating, not enough physical activity.” ( tweet ) “A life of excess is not a good life. Excess of anything leads to perversion and depression.” ( tweet ) “Depression is becoming a pandemic; its origins are complex, from pathology to negative lifestyles. A culture of prevention is vital.” ( tweet ) The tweets above suggest that excessive food and sedentary lifestyle are the causal factors for depression. While excessive food or sedentary lifestyle is both correlated to several other illnesses, there is no direct evidence of lifestyle choices as a direct causal factor for depression. A large majority of people face adverse events, but only a proportion of them acquire clinical depression. The health of the non-affected individuals, who remain healthy following an adverse life event, is not attributed to better coping strategies such as eating healthy or exercising. These strategies may be helpful in dealing with a negative emotion, such as sadness or frustration, but as we will discuss below, depressive individuals have a biological risk factor beyond their control. With scientific evidence, it is widely accepted that a combination of Biological (genetic vulnerability, pubertal hormones, pubertal timing and development) factors as vulnerabilities, that interact with Environment (negative and adverse life events) that account for heightened rates of depression in humans. Study on genetic causes: There are several studies that have identified various genes that have a major role in major depressive disorder (MDD), commonly known as depression. A study on adoption and twin studies in the American Journal of Psychiatry published in 2000, concluded that while environment was significant to the cause of depression, it is reliant on genetic heritability from biological parents. The study concluded that major depression is inheritable from genes and its inheritability results from genetic influences. Study on environmental causes: Another study, published in 1999 in the American Journal of Psychiatry suggested that although stressful life events have a substantial causal correlation episode of major depression, about 1/3 rd of the association between stressful life events and onsets of depression is non-causal. This could be because individuals (biologically) predisposed to depression may select themselves into high-risk environments. Hence, depression has distinct molecular physiology and genetics. A lowered emotional state such as temporary sadness (due to the environment), is not the causal factor without the inherited genes that are linked with depression. Another example is that of post-partum depression, which is clearly linked with physiological changes in the mother after birth, instead of sheer sadness or grief, and have been shown to be ameliorated with robust anti-depressants. About, 13-19.8% of women experience a mental health disorder, mainly depression, after giving birth. “Fear, anger, misery, frustration, depression, and despair are all products of a mind that you have not taken charge of.” ( tweet ) The above tweet suggests that emotions such as fear, anger, misery, frustration, despair as well as depression are a result of our unguarded consciousness. However, these temporary emotions, apart from depression, are a part of everyday experience of a healthy person. On the other hand, depression is not an emotion but a long-lasting mental disease. There are significant differences between grief and bereavement as compared to depression: For some people, it can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression as they share many of the same characteristics. Grief or sadness is a completely natural and healthy response to a loss, while depression is a chronic but treatable illness. While the onset of most depression types is positively correlated with adverse negative life events, sadness and other negative emotions are temporary and will disappear while people who are depressed constantly feel sad, unable to enjoy anything and find it difficult to be positive about the future. “ Frustration, discouragement and depression mean you are working against yourself” ( tweet ) “Depression makes you cynical and is deeply self-damaging. Depressed people only hurt themselves more .” ( tweet ) “Only because you have frozen your intelligence, there is room for depression.” ( tweet ) The above tweets are widely circulated myths on depression. Needless to say to anyone who has experienced clinical depression knows that ‘It is not a choice’ While both negative emotions and depression are not ideal state of conditions, the tweets portray that the individual has the power to change depression. With time, negative emotions can be replaced with positive, but it is not the case with depression. The symptoms of depression are that the individual does not have the motivation to make any changes to the condition. Seeking therapy or treatments also require motivation and hence, many are left untreated. “In yoga, depression is handled at the level of body, mind, and energies. Vibrant and balanced, you will naturally be blissful.” ( tweet ) “Today being Diwali, may this period of slow-down of life lead to contemplation, meditation rather than depression.” ( tweet ) While the tweets suggest depression is largely a non-physical condition (in the mind), there are studies that suggest that its effects are beyond the ‘mind’. A study published in 2000 in the American Journal of Psychiatry suggested that patients with depression had a significantly reduced (19%) hippocampus region of the brain associated with learning, memory and emotions. This result was mechanistically correlated with lowered glucocorticoid levels in depression and associated with damage to the hippocampus. A PET scan below compares brain activity during periods of depression (left) with normal brain activity (right). An increase of blue and green colours, along with decreased white and yellow areas, shows decreased brain activity due to depression. While research is full of literature on yoga and meditation for depression and anxiety, which is considered an effective ancillary treatment option for patients, not many studies compare effects of yoga with relaxation and/or aerobic exercise, for changes in severity of depression. A large number of these studies were found to be with high risk of bias. A meta-analysis study , found several low-risk biased studies, that combined 12 randomised controlled trials in 619 participants. In these studies, there was only a moderate evidence found for effects of yoga as compared to usual care, and limited evidence was found for yoga compared to relaxation and aerobic exercise. Hence, while yoga is certainly effective for mild depression, it has shown limited efficacy in comparison to relaxation or aerobic exercise. “The rate of suicides propelled by depression & frustration in the US & several other parts of the world is alarming. Raising human consciousness is the only solution to prevent this rapidly unfolding tragedy. ( tweet ) This was tweeted following the death of celebrities, Kate Spade & Anthony Bourdain, in the US. While rates of suicides are certainly increasing, more in men (3.53 x) than in women , and a large proportion (estimated at about 60%) is due to depression; frustration in healthy individuals is short lasting. Previously Mr. Vasudev had made statements in support of mercury usage in traditional Indian medicines and Alt News had explained why this was dangerous. While he is known for several pseudoscientific claims, such as converting liquid mercury into solid clay like substance, with his bare hands, at room temperature, the topic of depression frequently reappears. In the light of his tweets, it is evident that Mr. Vasudev and other such spiritual gurus use Yoga, Ayurveda and other similar traditional ancient Indian practices, often completely pseudoscientific, to capitalise on the largest mental health problem of the world. Since, myths and misinformation on mental health conditions are widely prevalent, these spiritual Gurus use ancient knowledge, religious symbolism and, in this case, their fluency of the English language, to misinform the people and shaming them of their lifestyle choices. Hence, it is imperative to raise awareness on depression as a major disorder- with intrinsic biological basis, its symptoms, causes and its robust clinical treatments that work, and its ancillary treatments such as yoga or relaxation and exercise that can help with the condition. For more information, refer to the WHO website pages on depression . If you think you may be depressed, immediately refer to your physician. “The main cause of depression in the world today is too much eating, not enough physical activity.” Jaggi Vasudev, a spritual guru also known as Sadhguru, frequently gives twitter sermons on depression. He confuses depression, a clinical condition with a proven biological basis (also known as major depressive disorder) with negative emotions such as sadness (experienced by healthy humans).

An infographic accompanied the tweet that advised a list that included ‘following a routine, travelling, being creative, taking multivitamins, thinking positively, practicing yoga, staying clean, sleeping for a minimum of eight hours, eating fruits and going for a walk’ as measures to help cope with depression. #Depression is a state of low mood that affects a person’s thought, behaviour, feeling & sense of well-being. One must take up activities that keep him or her boosted in order to cope with depression. #SwasthaBharat #MentalHealth #LetsTalk pic.twitter.com/6eElyQe4Rm — Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) June 16, 2018 The tweet also suggested that “Depression is a state of low mood that affects a person’s thought, behaviour, feeling, entrance of well-being. One must take up activities that keep him or her boosted in order to cope with depression.” A few days later, the National Health Portal (NHP), a government body, released a statement on their website elaborating on the mental health disorders, mainly: anxiety, depression & sleep disorders. In one of the sections, they maintained that mental exercises that included “t raining to ‘tune’ to the happenings inside & outside the body ” is an effective way to deal with mental health illnesses. But, the NHP doesn’t mention how to practice this ‘ tuning ’. The NHP article states: “It is also necessary that, for the mental faculties to grow, they must be constantly trained and tuned to the happenings inside and outside the body. Practice helps to develop our faculty and allows it to remain in a state of excellence. We know that practice makes a man perfect. And thus he is able to counter innumerable challenges which are an inevitable part of life. Be it fire or be it nanotechnology, no great invention or discovery has come without overcoming challenges and more so not without the sanity of a balanced mind. We must therefore keep facing challenges if we want our mind to remain healthy.” The NHP article also emphasized on ‘ food for thought ’. It stated: “ As in the case of maintaining general hygiene for physical health, developing a healthy mind is through imbibing good food for thought or ‘ChaitikAhaar’. This food for thought can be imbibed by participating in healthy discussions, socializing, meeting new people and meditating. Good and healthy food for thought is as important as nutritious food for body. ” The NHP also blamed socio-economic problems like ‘ poor socioeconomic state, a broken family and professional difficulties’ and, added that clean and positive surroundings can help heal these problems. Lastly, they also added that homeopathy can correct these issues. WHO acknowledges that depression is the most common mental health disability. It can be as debilitating as any physical disability. Everyday actions such as going to work, or, even getting out of bed for the day, can be an effort. Both MoH&FW and NHP suggested that mental health disorders like depression can be coped with lifestyle choices such as keeping healthy. They also suggested that depression can be caused by socio-economics which can lead to a low emotional state like sadness. Both of the aforementioned are untrue. The contributing factors to depression are, social, psychological as well as biological . It is true that people who have undergone adverse life events can develop depression but there are a range of genetic and environmental predispositions which can act as contributing factors. There are several studies that have identified various genes that have a major role in major depressive disorder (MDD), commonly known as depression. A study on adoption and twin studies in the America Journal of Psychiatry published in 2000, concluded that while environment was significant to the cause of depression, it is reliant on genetic heritability from biological parents. It is informative to study twins separated and raised in different environments, especially monozygotic (identical) twins as they have similar genetic makeup. The study concluded that major depression is inheritable from genes and its inheritability results from genetic influences. Hence, depression has a distinct molecular physiology and genetics. A lowered emotional state such as sadness (due to the environment), is not the causing factor without the inherited genes that are linked with depression. Contrarily, sadness is an emotion and can be experienced by healthy individuals. Hence, sadness alone, or from the NHP statement ‘negativity’ alone cannot be a cause of depression. While, NHP quoted statements from WHO on mental health; WHO, nowhere suggested that mental health can be ‘maintained’ by ‘ tuning ’ exercises, the meaning of which is not explicitly described. A statement by WHO on mental health recognises the importance of scalable psychological interventions as well as antidepressant medications (such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) in case of depression. In contrast, the NHP provided no suggestions of seeking professional help similar to the statements by WHO. A study in the prestigious journal ‘Science’, published in 2018, suggested that there is a shared genetic basis or heritability in major common disorders of the brain and this heritability (inherited from parents’ genes) depended on how early the onset of the disorder started in an individual. Hence, the study concluded that genes have a huge role in not just depression, but in several other mental health disorders. While some of the options in the MoH&FW tweet can help alleviate one’s low emotional state such as sadness; lifestyle choices, such as being creative or travelling, cannot be categorised as effective treatments for dealing with depression. In addition to that, there was no advices for proven & effective treatments available for clinical depression. The only mention related to medications was of multivitamin pills which, according to a study, have failed to show any efficacy in treating or in decreasing its prevalence. The NHP’s suggestion for treatment – homeopathy, is scientifically unproven to treat depression from a physiological perspective. Several studies, both as individual studies specifically for depression and a meta-analysis of several studies, conducted on homeopathic treatments, concluded that homeopathy is ineffective for depression. In an earlier article on Alt News, we have described the working principles of this unscientific model of therapy. Although, treatments like homeopathy may have an impact as a placebo (a non-treatment or a sham treatment creating an effect like the real drug). If that is the case, a study that systematically tests homeopathic remedies against the most commonly prescribed drugs in anxiety and/or depression must be considered. We found a thorough review in the British Medical Journal that conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials in humans for the efficacy of homeopathy and found only one study on depression that compared the drug diazepam (not the first choice for treating depression but prescribed for clinical anxiety) with homeopathic treatment. This study, from France, which was in favour of homeopathy for depression was retracted from publication because of low methodological quality. Even though retracted, this study is still used to substantiate arguments on homeopathy till date by homeopathic websites and blogs. In contrast, a study published in 2018, in The Lancet , compared efficacy of 21 antidepressant drugs, against placebo, for the acute treatment for major depressive disorder. This study by a collaborative team of psychiatrists and scientists across the UK, USA, France, Switzerland, Germany, The Netherlands and Japan concluded that all 21 antidepressants tested were more efficacious than a placebo drug. The suggestions for depression in the ministry’s tweet and, also, in the statement by the NHP indicates the extent of misinformed medical advice passed from the health advisors of the ministry to the general population. Carelessly, equating socio-economics as the only cause for mental health issues, without considering the research behind these illnesses, is grave medical negligence and lack of diligence coming from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the mainstream health ministry in India. The National Health Portal claims to be a portal to establish a single point access for authenticated health information for citizens, students, healthcare professionals and researchers. Its unconditional support for homeopathy while neglecting all the proven treatments available is irresponsible, misleading and indicates disregard for the evidence-based practice and the profession of medicine. “#Depression is a state of low mood that affects a person’s thought, behaviour, feeling & sense of well-being. One must take up activities that keep him or her boosted in order to cope with depression. #SwasthaBharat #MentalHealth #LetsTalk“. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) Twitter account posted the aforementioned text as a public awareness measure on depression. An infographic accompanied the tweet that advised a list that included ‘following a routine, travelling, being creative, taking multivitamins, thinking positively, practicing yoga, staying clean, sleeping for a minimum of eight hours, eating fruits and going for a walk’ as measures to help cope with depression. #Depression is a state of low mood that affects a person’s thought, behaviour, feeling & sense of well-being. One must take up activities that keep him or her boosted in order to cope with depression. #SwasthaBharat #MentalHealth #LetsTalk pic.twitter.com/6eElyQe4Rm — Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) June 16, 2018 The tweet also suggested that “Depression is a state of low mood that affects a person’s thought, behaviour, feeling, entrance of well-being. One must take up activities that keep him or her boosted in order to cope with depression.” A few days later, the National Health Portal (NHP), a government body, released a statement on their website elaborating on the mental health disorders, mainly: anxiety, depression & sleep disorders. In one of the sections, they maintained that mental exercises that included “training to ‘tune’ to the happenings inside & outside the body” is an effective way to deal with mental health illnesses. But, the NHP doesn’t mention how to practice this ‘tuning’. The NHP article states: “It is also necessary that, for the mental faculties to grow, they must be constantly trained and tuned to the happenings inside and outside the body. Practice helps to develop our faculty and allows it to remain in a state of excellence. We know that practice makes a man perfect. And thus he is able to counter innumerable challenges which are an inevitable part of life. Be it fire or be it nanotechnology, no great invention or discovery has come without overcoming challenges and more so not without the sanity of a balanced mind. We must therefore keep facing challenges if we want our mind to remain healthy.” The NHP article also emphasized on ‘food for thought’. It stated: “As in the case of maintaining general hygiene for physical health, developing a healthy mind is through imbibing good food for thought or ‘ChaitikAhaar’. This food for thought can be imbibed by participating in healthy discussions, socializing, meeting new people and meditating. Good and healthy food for thought is as important as nutritious food for body.” The NHP also blamed socio-economic problems like ‘poor socioeconomic state, a broken family and professional difficulties’ and, added that clean and positive surroundings can help heal these problems. Lastly, they also added that homeopathy can correct these issues. Depression: Is it just psychological? WHO acknowledges that depression is the most common mental health disability. It can be as debilitating as any physical disability. Everyday actions such as going to work, or, even getting out of bed for the day, can be an effort. Both MoH&FW and NHP suggested that mental health disorders like depression can be coped with lifestyle choices such as keeping healthy. They also suggested that depression can be caused by socio-economics which can lead to a low emotional state like sadness. Both of the aforementioned are untrue. The contributing factors to depression are, social, psychological as well as biological. It is true that people who have undergone adverse life events can develop depression but there are a range of genetic and environmental predispositions which can act as contributing factors. Research on causes of depression There are several studies that have identified various genes that have a major role in major depressive disorder (MDD), commonly known as depression. A study on adoption and twin studies in the America Journal of Psychiatry published in 2000, concluded that while environment was significant to the cause of depression, it is reliant on genetic heritability from biological parents. It is informative to study twins separated and raised in different environments, especially monozygotic (identical) twins as they have similar genetic makeup. The study concluded that major depression is inheritable from genes and its inheritability results from genetic influences. Hence, depression has a distinct molecular physiology and genetics. A lowered emotional state such as sadness (due to the environment), is not the causing factor without the inherited genes that are linked with depression. Contrarily, sadness is an emotion and can be experienced by healthy individuals. Hence, sadness alone, or from the NHP statement ‘negativity’ alone cannot be a cause of depression. Mental health While, NHP quoted statements from WHO on mental health; WHO, nowhere suggested that mental health can be ‘maintained’ by ‘tuning’ exercises, the meaning of which is not explicitly described. A statement by WHO on mental health recognises the importance of scalable psychological interventions as well as antidepressant medications (such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) in case of depression. In contrast, the NHP provided no suggestions of seeking professional help similar to the statements by WHO. A study in the prestigious journal ‘Science’, published in 2018, suggested that there is a shared genetic basis or heritability in major common disorders of the brain and this heritability (inherited from parents’ genes) depended on how early the onset of the disorder started in an individual. Hence, the study concluded that genes have a huge role in not just depression, but in several other mental health disorders. Treatments While some of the options in the MoH&FW tweet can help alleviate one’s low emotional state such as sadness; lifestyle choices, such as being creative or travelling, cannot be categorised as effective treatments for dealing with depression. In addition to that, there was no advices for proven & effective treatments available for clinical depression. The only mention related to medications was of multivitamin pills which, according to a study, have failed to show any efficacy in treating or in decreasing its prevalence. The NHP’s suggestion for treatment – homeopathy, is scientifically unproven to treat depression from a physiological perspective. Several studies, both as individual studies specifically for depression and a meta-analysis of several studies, conducted on homeopathic treatments, concluded that homeopathy is ineffective for depression. In an earlier article on Alt News, we have described the working principles of this unscientific model of therapy. Although, treatments like homeopathy may have an impact as a placebo (a non-treatment or a sham treatment creating an effect like the real drug). If that is the case, a study that systematically tests homeopathic remedies against the most commonly prescribed drugs in anxiety and/or depression must be considered. We found a thorough review in the British Medical Journal that conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials in humans for the efficacy of homeopathy and found only one study on depression that compared the drug diazepam (not the first choice for treating depression but prescribed for clinical anxiety) with homeopathic treatment. This study, from France, which was in favour of homeopathy for depression was retracted from publication because of low methodological quality.

Its unconditional support for homeopathy while neglecting all the proven treatments available is irresponsible, misleading and indicates disregard for the evidence-based practice and the profession of medicine. In conclusion, depression is a seriously debilitating illness similar to other types of disability and can lead to suicide. Although, it is important to have a healthy lifestyle and nutrition, these changes cannot cure depression. If you think you have depression, approach a medical professional for diagnosis and, if diagnosed, ask about the treatment options available.

Many of the social media messages are also accompanied with the following image. During the course of this article, we will discuss: 1. Nipah virus infection – Extent of outbreak, symptoms and causes 2. World Health Organization’s (WHO) statement which states that there is no official drug or vaccine for Nipah virus infection . 3. Publicly available studies on Gelsemium 200 which proves its ineffectiveness as a treatment (or as a preventative measure) for Nipah virus infection. Following the outbreak of the Nipah Virus infection that started off in Kerala and possibly spread to Karnataka, 15 people have died suspected from this infection. In Kolkata, a soldier has also reportedly died due to a suspected Nipah virus infection after a trip to Kerala. Symptoms of Nipah virus infection are both respiratory and neurological and can be presented as an acute respiratory infection (flu like symptoms), headache, fever or can be asymptomatic. Another 16 have been diagnosed and the case fatality rate is about 86%. World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that Nipah Virus (NiV) infection is a form of zoonosis, a disease that transmits from animals to humans, is spread through consumption of palm sap that has been contaminated by fruit bats – a natural host of the virus but have also been found to spread from pigs and through human-human contact. A lot of misinformation has been shared on social media and on whatsapp about alternative treatments for NiV infection. The message quoted at the start of this article was shared about 5 days ago and is still viral on social media. Is there any truth to the claim? World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that there is no official drug or vaccine for Nipah infection . The primary treatment for both animals and humans is intensive support care such as isolation, hygiene and symptomatic treatments. The drug Gelsemium 200 , a homeopathic therapy is prescribed as one of the forms of treatment for dengue by the Ministry of AYUSH , and the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) , a government body for homeopathy research under the ministry of AYUSH. It should also be noted that according to WHO guidelines , neither treatment nor vaccine has been found for dengue fever as well, and therapy is heavily reliant on supportive care. While the AYUSH ministry or its ministers haven’t officially suggested this treatment for Nipah virus infection , but only for dengue, we assessed, whether it is known to have any efficacy at all in both, NiV and dengue infection, or any other conditions. We found two human studies that discussed that effect of Gelsemium in anxiety and heart rate variability and used the dilutions of this homeopathic drug with 5CH/15CH and 200CH respectively. The Gelsemium 5CH/15CH study , published in The Journal of Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology , reported no significant changes in anxiety in patients as compared to a placebo treatment (e.g. sugar pill). Whereas, the Gelsemium 200CH study conducted at CCRH and published in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine reported small changes in heart rate variability with only a small number of sample size (n=5 subjects) out of which only 60% (n=3 subjects) responded to changes in heart rate 20% (n=2 subjects) responded to changes in blood flow. Such small sample sizes and its effects due to a random chance event or experimenter bias as the study was not double blinded. Most importantly Gelsemium 200 is a diluted drug as per homeopathic dilutions procedures in either alcohol or water poured over sugar pills, where 200 is the centesimal scale of the dilution that equated to 30x. In homeopathy, 1x means the main concentrated drug called “mother tincture” drug is diluted to a 1/100 (decimal scale: 10 -2 ) dilution rate and then shaken vigorously (dynamization). Repeated this procedure 30x times will give a result described in the drug formulation above. That means, for Gelsemium 200, only 1 ml drug is present in 10000000000, 0000000000, 0000000000 ml of water or alchohol. This hypothesis that suggests such weak dilutions of any drug, whether Gelsemium 200 or other drugs prescribed by homeopathy can cure anything better than plain sugar pills is unscientific. In live systems such as cells, or animal and human bodies, there is need for a minimum dosage of any active ingredient, to have an effect and homeopathic dilutions do not meet that standard. For further reading on how drug formulations work in homeopathy, read our previous article Is homeopathy an effective form of treatment? at AltNews. It is evident that the drug Gelsemium 200 has no effective role in Nipah Virus therapy and such information should not be spread. Particularly, in cases of priority diseases, information spread through social media can have harmful consequences such as self-treatment and denial of treatment of supportive care by assuming an alternative treatment will be able to cure the illness. If anyone is with found with acute symptoms of Nipah virus infections, it is advisable to isolate and seek help at the nearest medical facility. Secondary infections are highly prevalent in family and friends as well as health care workers. Researchers in the USA and Japan are conducting experiments to find effective solutions for Nipah virus infections such as antiviral Favipiravir (T-705) but it has only been tested in animal models so far. However, it cannot be used in patients infected with Nipah virus without appropriate testing in humans. Other studies published have also been listed on PUBMED . “Gelsemium 200, Homeopathy medicine for Nipah Virus, Weekly 3 doses for 3 weeks. It can protect you from the virus.

Ministry of AYUSH and its associated bodies have argued that the clinical studies that have been undertaken for treatment of autism using alternative therapies have shown positive results. While inaugurating a homeopathy research lab at Dr Anjali Chatterjee Regional Research Institute for Homoeopathy, Union minister of state for AYUSH, Mr. Shripad Yesso Naik had claimed , “ This institute has undertaken several clinical research studies on autism, psoriasis, vitiligo, breast cancer, hypertension, migraine etc. along with proving of new drugs in homoeopathy with their clinical validations. ” Yet another line of treatment for autism using a combined therapy of Siddha, Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Yoga as well as Homeopathy has been claimed to be devised at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy. In support of this line of treatment, the district siddha medical officer Dr S Kamaraj had claimed , “ Our (traditional Indian) medicine system has treatment for autism. But we are trying it for the first time in the government sector in the state. Initially, the autistic patients will receive treatment from any one of the methods. The progress of the patient will be monitored. If the patient requires the treatment in another method, it will be given. Ultimately, there would be great improvement in the patient’s activity ”. In this case, it is being claimed that the knowledge prescribed in the textbooks of Indian medicine can treat autism. Following these claims, we evaluated the research (scientific data published in journal articles and details of the clinical trials) to assess whether the above claims on autism treatments are backed by scientific evidence. Alt News discussed the issue with Professor Edzard Ernst , MD, PhD, Germany and has authored several books on alternative treatments including the most comprehensive lexicon till date of Homeopathy. Prof. Ernst said and we quote, “These treatments (that) are being promoted for autism, they are also frequently used for it, but there is – as far as I can see – not a shred of evidence that they affect the natural history of the disease. In my view, the promotion of unproven therapies is irresponsible and unethical .” Hence, in the course of this article, we will discuss: The lack of evidence available for these alternative treatments thus showing its lack of efficacy, The lack of various scientific parameters of published research studies that claim to treat autistic patients Alt News examined the claims made regarding published clinical studies showing efficacy of alternative treatments for autism using resources from Google Scholar and PUBMED. Medical research on new mechanisms of a disease condition or information on new treatments are indexed by Google Scholar and PUBMED, health practitioners use the clinical and laboratory research to verify and seek this new information. As a corollary, the absence of scientific research information about a particular treatment in Google Scholar and PUBMED indicates lack of clinical or laboratory research for those treatments. While researching published articles in PUBMED, an open source for health research funded by the US National Institute of Health (NIH), revealed no results on autism and AYUSH based treatments published by Indian researchers. On the other hand, Google Scholar gave a few results related to autism and AYUSH treatments that were directed to any Indian publication listed as below: 1. Praful Barvalia, Homeopathic links (2011) Autism Spectrum Disorder: Holistic Homeopathy 2. A review paper published in 2018 by Prashant L Patil and Pravin W Bonde Department of Kaumarbhritya, Government Ayurved College, Nanded, India – “An Overview and Approach towards Autism and its Management in Ayurveda” 3. Several articles by a single author Mandayam Anandampillai Rajalakshmi uploaded in PDF format in research gate, which is a social media website for scientists, but not in a peer-reviewed scientific journal even though it claimed be so ( Link 1 , Link 2 and Link 3 ). 4. Mukherjee et al (201 7 ) published in the International Journal of Ayurveda and Pharma Research titled “Studies of brahmi based unani compound formulation on autism to assess its efficacy”. A single case study presented to illustrate the treatment of autism by a team at the Spandan Holistic Multidisciplinary Institute . The institute also claimed to treat 123 autistic children until 2010 but none of the other case studies were discussed. This study lacked any form of controls or comparison with control treatments. Also, the sample size here is only n=1. The outcomes of the other 123 children were not discussed. This seriously questions the attribution to homeopathy treatment with respect to the little improvement the patient experienced. Moreover, Mr Praful Barvalia, is the Chairman and director of Spandan Holistic institute, Mumbai, which claims to be awarded as the most prestigious Centre for excellence in homeopathic childcare & rehabilitation by Ministry of Ayush, Government of India. It should be also noted that this study was not published in a mainstream scientific peer reviewed mental health or autism related journal but in a homeopathy journal. Hence, with lack of controls or comparison with placebo treatments in just a single sample size, ‘improvements’ of patient condition, if any, cannot be attributed to homeopathy. Even for statistical analysis such as t-tests to show significant improvement, a minimum of n=3 patients need to be considered. Therefore, homeopathic research in India, is proven to be illegitimate for autism ( as it has been for other conditions across the world ). This was a review paper with no other primary data but only methodology. Interestingly, this paper talked about the internal and external remedies as described by the “Acharyas” but gave no reference to where this knowledge is published and how it is tested for effectiveness. Hence, a single review paper in the absence of research data doesn’t prove the validity of Ayurveda for autism. No other data exists to prove that this methodology described in the ancient texts have been proven to cure autism Link 1: A review paper that discusses, the effect of music on autistic children Link 2: A single case study, no controls and no experimental conditions. A report on symptoms and suggestions for diagnosis without actual experiments being conducted. Link 3: This was a conference proceeding presented at XII National Homoeopathic Congress in Khajuraho, India. Also, the experiments were found to be incorrectly tested, i.e. lack of controls and the reports were based purely on subjective behavioural measurements that were not peer reviewed. All the papers linked above were not peer-reviewed (not validated by other scientists of the same research area). This peer review method is a gold-standard for scientists that publish their data. Other scientists in the same field must review and accept or reject research work based on several scientific parameters. Hence, a non peer-reviewed article such as a blog entry, news article or a paper uploaded on research gate doesn’t classify as scientific data. Also, link 3 was the only research study here that again did not feature any controls in the so called ‘improvement’. Mukherjee et al (2017) published in the International Journal of Ayurveda and Pharma Research that discussed a small amount of change in experimental group assessed (using questionnaires) after a treatment of Brahmi medications. Only showing a p value significance, the study fails to discuss the number of recruited subjects or any other behavioural measurement conducted to compare with the control subjects. When carefully observing the data presented in a table rather than a visual graph (presented as median + standard deviation or error), we found that the error bars were significantly high that it could cancel out the drug effect. This could, probably be the reason for not reporting this data in a graph. Hence, when carefully studying the published data, it is likely that the researcher Arun Mukherjee and his colleagues tried to bury a ‘no-effect’ with statistical numbers, i.e. the drug may not have had any significant effect on the patient condition but wasn’t evidently stated as such. Additionally, in India, a clinical trials registry (open access to public) shows the current research being conducted as a form of registered clinical trials. This means that in order to conduct any clinical research in humans, researchers need to apply and register all the relevant details of the study such as what is the preliminary or secondary data, name of the chief scientist, formulation of the drug and the funding source. This registry revealed several studies being conducted on autism and alternative treatments, but none of these studies showed any preliminary data that supported the claims of the respective trials on the basis of which the clinical trial was registered. The prevelance of alternative treatments for autistic patients possibly reflects on the fact that a large amount of alternative treatments make highly exaggerated claims that may seem hard to compete with, as opposed to realistic evidence-based treatments. However, the scientific literature research on these claims do not give any evidence to support the claim that AYUSH based treatments work . As shown above, single case studies with lack of controls, erroneously run statistics, reviews disguised as data publications and sub-standard data was found when carefully studying the research on autism with respect to AYUSH therapies. Indian researchers and AYUSH ministers made claims suggesting autism can be treated with traditional Indian therapies backed by newly emerging studies conducted by the institutes associated with the ministry of AYUSH. These claims include publicly funded alternative treatments and have gained huge traction with its gigantic budget increase of 13% in the recent Union budget . Alternative treatments Ayurveda, Siddha, Naturopathy, Yoga & Homeopathy are being increasingly promoted as the legitimate and only treatments for Autism by the ministry of AYUSH, a government body, and private practitioners such as Dr. Batra’s clinic. Autism is a neurological disorder that manifests during early childhood, irrespective of gender, race or socio-economic status. It is mainly characterized by its unique social interactions, non-standard ways of learning, keen interests in specific subjects, inclination to routines, challenges in typical communications and particular ways of processing sensory information. Broadly, people who have autism or, are on the autistic spectrum (including autism spectrum disorder or ASD), suffer from learning differences and developmental disabilities. Alternative treatments for disorders such as Autism have increasingly come under scrutiny by practitioners of modern medicine and is a subject of much debate. Ministry of AYUSH and its associated bodies have argued that the clinical studies that have been undertaken for treatment of autism using alternative therapies have shown positive results. While inaugurating a homeopathy research lab at Dr Anjali Chatterjee Regional Research Institute for Homoeopathy, Union minister of state for AYUSH, Mr. Shripad Yesso Naik had claimed, “This institute has undertaken several clinical research studies on autism, psoriasis, vitiligo, breast cancer, hypertension, migraine etc. along with proving of new drugs in homoeopathy with their clinical validations.” Yet another line of treatment for autism using a combined therapy of Siddha, Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Yoga as well as Homeopathy has been claimed to be devised at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy.

In my view, the promotion of unproven therapies is irresponsible and unethical.” Hence, in the course of this article, we will discuss: The lack of evidence available for these alternative treatments thus showing its lack of efficacy, The lack of various scientific parameters of published research studies that claim to treat autistic patients Researching evidence for Autism treatments based on AYUSH Alt News examined the claims made regarding published clinical studies showing efficacy of alternative treatments for autism using resources from Google Scholar and PUBMED. Medical research on new mechanisms of a disease condition or information on new treatments are indexed by Google Scholar and PUBMED, health practitioners use the clinical and laboratory research to verify and seek this new information. As a corollary, the absence of scientific research information about a particular treatment in Google Scholar and PUBMED indicates lack of clinical or laboratory research for those treatments. While researching published articles in PUBMED, an open source for health research funded by the US National Institute of Health (NIH), revealed no results on autism and AYUSH based treatments published by Indian researchers. On the other hand, Google Scholar gave a few results related to autism and AYUSH treatments that were directed to any Indian publication listed as below: 1. Praful Barvalia, Homeopathic links (2011) Autism Spectrum Disorder: Holistic Homeopathy 2. A review paper published in 2018 by Prashant L Patil and Pravin W Bonde Department of Kaumarbhritya, Government Ayurved College, Nanded, India – “An Overview and Approach towards Autism and its Management in Ayurveda” 3. Several articles by a single author Mandayam Anandampillai Rajalakshmi uploaded in PDF format in research gate, which is a social media website for scientists, but not in a peer-reviewed scientific journal even though it claimed be so (Link 1, Link 2 and Link 3). 4. Mukherjee et al (2017) published in the International Journal of Ayurveda and Pharma Research titled “Studies of brahmi based unani compound formulation on autism to assess its efficacy”. Publication 1: “Homeopathic links (2011) Autism Spectrum Disorder: Holistic Homeopathy” A single case study presented to illustrate the treatment of autism by a team at the Spandan Holistic Multidisciplinary Institute. The institute also claimed to treat 123 autistic children until 2010 but none of the other case studies were discussed. This study lacked any form of controls or comparison with control treatments. Also, the sample size here is only n=1. The outcomes of the other 123 children were not discussed. This seriously questions the attribution to homeopathy treatment with respect to the little improvement the patient experienced. Moreover, Mr Praful Barvalia, is the Chairman and director of Spandan Holistic institute, Mumbai, which claims to be awarded as the most prestigious Centre for excellence in homeopathic childcare & rehabilitation by Ministry of Ayush, Government of India. It should be also noted that this study was not published in a mainstream scientific peer reviewed mental health or autism related journal but in a homeopathy journal. Hence, with lack of controls or comparison with placebo treatments in just a single sample size, ‘improvements’ of patient condition, if any, cannot be attributed to homeopathy. Even for statistical analysis such as t-tests to show significant improvement, a minimum of n=3 patients need to be considered. Therefore, homeopathic research in India, is proven to be illegitimate for autism (as it has been for other conditions across the world). Publication 2: “An Overview and Approach towards Autism and its Management in Ayurveda” This was a review paper with no other primary data but only methodology. Interestingly, this paper talked about the internal and external remedies as described by the “Acharyas” but gave no reference to where this knowledge is published and how it is tested for effectiveness. Hence, a single review paper in the absence of research data doesn’t prove the validity of Ayurveda for autism. No other data exists to prove that this methodology described in the ancient texts have been proven to cure autism Publication 3: Three papers on research gate by a single author MA Rajalakshmi (Link 1, Link 2 and Link 3) Link 1: A review paper that discusses, the effect of music on autistic children Link 2: A single case study, no controls and no experimental conditions. A report on symptoms and suggestions for diagnosis without actual experiments being conducted. Link 3: This was a conference proceeding presented at XII National Homoeopathic Congress in Khajuraho, India. Also, the experiments were found to be incorrectly tested, i.e. lack of controls and the reports were based purely on subjective behavioural measurements that were not peer reviewed. All the papers linked above were not peer-reviewed (not validated by other scientists of the same research area). This peer review method is a gold-standard for scientists that publish their data. Other scientists in the same field must review and accept or reject research work based on several scientific parameters. Hence, a non peer-reviewed article such as a blog entry, news article or a paper uploaded on research gate doesn’t classify as scientific data. Also, link 3 was the only research study here that again did not feature any controls in the so called ‘improvement’. Publication 4: “Studies of brahmi based unani compound formulation on autism to assess its efficacy”. Mukherjee et al (2017) published in the International Journal of Ayurveda and Pharma Research that discussed a small amount of change in experimental group assessed (using questionnaires) after a treatment of Brahmi medications. Only showing a p value significance, the study fails to discuss the number of recruited subjects or any other behavioural measurement conducted to compare with the control subjects. When carefully observing the data presented in a table rather than a visual graph (presented as median + standard deviation or error), we found that the error bars were significantly high that it could cancel out the drug effect. This could, probably be the reason for not reporting this data in a graph. Hence, when carefully studying the published data, it is likely that the researcher Arun Mukherjee and his colleagues tried to bury a ‘no-effect’ with statistical numbers, i.e. the drug may not have had any significant effect on the patient condition but wasn’t evidently stated as such. Additionally, in India, a clinical trials registry (open access to public) shows the current research being conducted as a form of registered clinical trials. This means that in order to conduct any clinical research in humans, researchers need to apply and register all the relevant details of the study such as what is the preliminary or secondary data, name of the chief scientist, formulation of the drug and the funding source. This registry revealed several studies being conducted on autism and alternative treatments, but none of these studies showed any preliminary data that supported the claims of the respective trials on the basis of which the clinical trial was registered. Conclusion The prevelance of alternative treatments for autistic patients possibly reflects on the fact that a large amount of alternative treatments make highly exaggerated claims that may seem hard to compete with, as opposed to realistic evidence-based treatments. However, the scientific literature research on these claims do not give any evidence to support the claim that AYUSH based treatments work. As shown above, single case studies with lack of controls, erroneously run statistics, reviews disguised as data publications and sub-standard data was found when carefully studying the research on autism with respect to AYUSH therapies. Indian researchers and AYUSH ministers made claims suggesting autism can be treated with traditional Indian therapies backed by newly emerging studies conducted by the institutes associated with the ministry of AYUSH. These claims include publicly funded alternative treatments and have gained huge traction with its gigantic budget increase of 13% in the recent Union budget. As it is, legal battles, societal stigma and the perception of mental health illnesses makes an arduous task of public education on these issues. In addition to that, the government endorsing and funding institutions that give false hopes and claims to eradicate a complex disorder such as autism is morally unethical. The government as well as the health care providers should focus on giving education and direction to patients that are realistic, achievable and increase their quality of life.",Dr. Sumaiya Shaikh,False,,1

The ministry of AYUSH hosts the Central Council for Research in Homeopathy (CCRH) , that has completed 40 years of establishment suggesting that, in India, the promotion of homeopathy, goes beyond the conception of the AYUSH ministry in 2014. During the course of the article, we are hoping to tackle the misconception about homeopathy being a legitimate form of medical treatment. In the course of this article, we would like to discuss The principles of a modern scientific research methodology What is homeopathy: Its principles and mechanisms of action Placebo Effect: The mechanisms of action for homeopathy & other disproven treatment to work on some people, AND The reason for people to seek alternative medicine that does not pass the gold standard for medical treatment Although, homeopathy is ancient, modern medical research has changed radically, and with it, its capacity to comprehend our understanding of the human body. With changing times, holding on to old research as the absolute gospel without adding any progress established with the help of new technology, not only jeopardizes human life but adds to the suffering. As Professor Edzard Ernst, an academic physician and author of many books on complementary medicine including homeopathy , pointed out that, homeopathic practitioners “…live by (and from) the error of 200 years ago”. The modern scientific research, that has progressed and documented in the last century, has largely relied on a scientific methodology that is: 1. Unbiased: The medical researcher does not conduct studies with a pre-determined notion, that the therapy they are trying to research on, is better than other available therapies on the market. This also includes pharmaceutical companies or manufacturers with economic interests in funding the research of a given treatment. 2. Blinded: During the research of a particular therapy, studies are conducted on both healthy as well as clinical subjects (patients). Neither the medical researcher, nor the subjects, (on whom the test is conducted) should be aware of the drug study(s), or its effects, before its administration. 3. Controlled: The study, should include valid comparisons, i.e. the drug of interest compared with a non-drug (e.g. sugar pill or vehicle/placebo) to ensure that the drug has some effect- as opposed to not administering any drugs. Secondly, this new drug should be compared with the best drug in the market. In instances, where clinical trials are conducted on patients suffering from a particular type of disease, it is also unethical to let them consume sugar pills (as controls) without their knowledge for research purposes. Hence, in such instances, comparisons should always be made with the best drug available in the market. 4. With statistically significant treatment effects: Experiments that reveal statistically significant data must report appropriate statistical tests (e.g. one/ two-way ANOVA, P-value < 0.05, t-tests, etc.); with an appropriate number of replicates; appropriate error bars; and should be presented clearly in graphs or tables depicting the mean of the effect and its standard deviation (or the standard error of the mean). 5. In different conditions: The effect of the new treatment is replicated in different experimental conditions, if not, otherwise stated, so that the effect is significant enough in all conditions (e.g. in different subject groups such as gender, age groups, physiological conditions, co-treatment with different drugs) Most importantly, it is ensured that the data for scientific validity, efficacy and/or toxicity of a treatment is replicated, peer-reviewed by external experts in the field with no conflict of interests, and recorded and shared in the form of scientific scholarly articles. This method is used for understanding of basic sciences and mechanisms of the human body using molecules, proteins, cells, laboratory grown animals, healthy human subjects to clinical patients- and just about everything in between to ascertain whether a particular type of therapy has scientific evidence for efficacy and its toxicity. In instances, where a treatment produces side effects, a health practitioner then concludes, if the benefits it provides outweighs the side effects of the treatment. In the 17th century, Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician unable to find answers with the limited understanding of modern medicine as it existed then, invented Homeopathy. This invention was before the systematic pharmacological study of drug safety and efficacy existed, before the knowledge of anatomy and physiology in its present form, microbiology and the germ theory of disease, before the invention of general anaesthesia (chloroform was discovered in 1831) or aseptic techniques and their uses in surgery. After multiple failed experiments, he stumbled upon quinine containing cinchona tree bark discovered before 1570s as a muscle relaxant. He later used it to treat malaria and developed malaria like symptoms, oblivious to the other side effects and contraindications of this drug he developed the first law of homeopathy. 1. The Law of Similia Similibus Curentur ( Let likes be cured by likes) Also called the Law of Similitude : drugs causing symptoms that mimic a specific disease can be used to treat diseases that causes the same symptoms. 2. The Law of Single Remedy states that a prescription shouldn’t be given of more than one remedy at one point of time. If that doesn’t work, one should move on to the next remedy. If multiple treatments are given at the same time, it becomes difficult to conclude which one treated the condition. 3. The Law of Minimum Dose states that one should take the smallest dose to nudge one’s vital force to start the healing process. Hahnemann believed that healing should be “rapid, gently and permanent.” To use too much of a remedy frequently causes an aggravation of symptoms before any improvement is seen, thereby putting the individual off the modality 4. The Law of Direction of Cure states that If a disease is left untreated it moves in the opposite direction 5. The Law of Infinitesimal Doses Under this law, homeopathy claims that when drugs such as an extract from the chinchona tree bark is diluted in water or alcohol, they increase their therapeutic potential. This is conducted by a serial dilution process such that a 1:100 dilution, i.e. one mL of drug per 100 mL of water or alcohol is repeated from 6 to 30 times to produce the most potent drug. In between each such dilution process, the liquid is agitated violently- a process that claims to activate the drug properties. By this law, the minimum amount of potent homeopathy drug in the diluted liquid will be 1:100 ration repeated 6 times that will yield a maximum drug content with the ratio of 1:1000000000000 This means that a batch of 10,00,00,00,00 Litres of drug will contain only 1 mL of the actual drug compound, while the rest will be either water or alcohol. This diluted liquid, mostly water or alcohol is poured over small glucose balls that are to be consumed several times a day. Treating symptoms not diseases: Since the conception of this therapy was before the understanding of many physiological mechanisms or biological functionality, and as a disease was perceived as a symptom in singularity, not as a manifestation of a bigger disorder- it was believed that treating the symptom can make the disease disappear. Ironically, homeopathy also has the theory of disease with three miasms, which are responsible for all human diseases and the treatments should be directed at treating these problematic miasms as a root cause: 1. SYCOSIS: conditions worsened by damp weather and the sea. 2. SYPHILIS: diseases of the nervous system such as a range of psychological illnesses such as alcoholism, depression, loss of sensations, ulcerations; the blood and skeletal disorders like heart conditions etc 3. PSORA: diseases of a chronic nature, all skin diseases, mental illness other than syphilitic ones, allergies, varicose veins, haemorrhoids, most dysfunctional diseases of organs and systems, etc. Hence, each symptom is addressed instead of looking at the root cause of treatment- which the homeopaths claim to treat. e.g. Pain is a symptom of many disorders from cancer, diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders to injury and trauma. Treating the pain will not address the diabetes in a diabetic neuropathy patient as it has to be dealt with mechanistically. A practice of validation through repetition of 4-5 doses a day, may induce a placebo like effect- something that may be holding the value of homeopathy till this date. A “placebo effect” is something that can seem like a real treatment but it isn’t. Such treatments do not contain any active substance to produce a change in effect but they still do, sometimes, in some people. There is a large amount of research and theories constructed for the placebo, one of them is of the mind-body. In theory, these placebo therapies rely on a patients’ expectation of a treatment. The higher the expectation, the higher the change of a placebo effect to occur. Notably, it is a chance phenomenon, and in cases of critical conditions and in professional medical practice, luck or chance has little space or value. However, in conditions where side effects of the drugs are high, placebo therapy can improve treatment and lower the cost of treatment at the same time. Nevertheless, it is controversial, as for patients seeking medical treatment, it can be unethical to give placebo without their knowledge and where patient is expecting a working solution. At the same time, placebo may not work when a patient knows it is placebo. Placebo is one such explanation of how homeopathy may have worked in some people. Several highly reputable scientific journals such as the list below have published studies that confirm time and again that the homeopathy method of treatment may work as placebo and there may not be any scientific basis for it. Shang, Aijing, et al . “Are the clinical effects of homeopathy placebo effects? Comparative study of placebo-controlled trials of homeopathy and allopathy.” The Lancet 366.9487 (2005): 726-732. Conclusion: Biases are present in placebo-controlled trials of both homeopathy and conventional medicine. When account was taken for these biases in the analysis, there was weak evidence for a specific effect of homoeopathic remedies, but strong evidence for specific effects of conventional interventions. This finding is compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects. Nuhn, Tobias, Rainer Lüdtke, and Max Geraedts . “Placebo effect sizes in homeopathic compared to conventional drugs–a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.” Homeopathy 99.1 (2010): 76-82. Conclusion: Placebo effects in RCTs on classical homeopathy did not appear to be larger than placebo effects in conventional medicine. Also, the Australian NHMRC, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, after analysing over 1800 scientific papers has concluded that homeopathy “relies on super-diluted substances” and has given the final verdict on the ineffectiveness of homeopathy as a treatment based on evidence based practice in a variety of clinical conditions. In essence, it concluded that there is no scientific basis for homeopathy and no quality evidence of its efficacy. As discussed above, with very little active ingredient and effects largely based on placebo, treatment with homeopathy is bound to have very little side effects- apart from spiking up the blood glucose in small amounts. As an informed consumer of medical therapies, one must ask several important questions, such as: Why do people still use homeopathy or other disproven therapies if they fail at substantiating their claims for a scientific mechanism? The answer to this resides beyond the scope of a scientific understanding of a diseased body. It lies in; 1. The economic model of the health system: In a largely privatized health industry such as in India, homeopathy (consisting mainly of water/ethanol and sugar) is much cheaper as a treatment when compared to modern therapy. 2. In the expectations of patients created by alternative practitioners: False claims that suggest complete eradication of a disease (e.g. autism) through alternative treatments which is not achievable through modern medicine yet, and; 3. The role of government: To oversee that such misinformation, fallacies and unscientific research methods are not a part of the official public health system, i.e., propagated through official sources and government ministers. In India, the Ministry of AYUSH has a Central council for research in homeopathy (CCRH), a fully funded government body to conduct research in homeopathy- a research area that has been increasingly pushed into mainstream medical science since the ministry was formed in 2014. In this year alone, the current government has outrightly promoted these alternative therapies by increasing 13% funding to the existing AYUSH budget. Also, since 2014, the government has created a separate ministry for AYUSH which is independent of the health ministry. Moreover, by trying to introduce the crosspathy bill , where AYUSH practitioners can practice basic modern medicine, the govermnt is legitimizing the practice of non-evidence-based practice such as homeopathy. In other departments of AYUSH as well, the emphasis on the scientific methodology of research is absent and elaborate claims are made to suggest fallacies not just in medical sciences but also in other sciences, something that even Hahnemann as a physician may disprove of. Samuel Hahnemann, born on the 10th of April 1755 in Meissen, a small town in Eastern Germany was the father of homeopathy whose ideas have been documented, referred to and practised upon widely by the world’s homeopathic practitioners. He has written close to 110 books but the Organon of Medicine remains one of his most popular work. Homeopathy is one of the key branches of the ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha & Homeopathy) in the government of India. The ministry of AYUSH hosts the Central Council for Research in Homeopathy (CCRH), that has completed 40 years of establishment suggesting that, in India, the promotion of homeopathy, goes beyond the conception of the AYUSH ministry in 2014.

Conclusion: Understanding the basic principles of homeopathy, in particular, the law of infinitesimal doses, it is clear that the medicine does not contain enough drug to treat any disorder, i.e. it either consists largely of water or alcohol, poured over sugar balls. While thoroughly researched evidence-based pharmacology suggests the optimum drug dosage in the body is a major contributing factor for drug efficacy. Therefore, according to the modern scientific explanation, these homeopathic drugs simply should not work based on a mechanism, but may work, for some, as a placebo. Thus, the inconsistent homeopathic efficacy in some ailments, as we observe in some patients, can only be attributed to its placebo effect.",Dr. Sumaiya Shaikh,,,1

Sadhguru indulges...,,"On the 8 th of February 2018, Yogi Sadhguru from the Isha foundation tweeted that: “Responsible usage of mercury for medicinal and yogic purposes must be allowed. Indian Alchemy is largely mercury based and losing it to uninformed paranoia will be a great loss to humanity.” This statement was made following 7 th of February 2018, when the Union Cabinet, India agreed to approve the enactment of the ban on mercury as part of the Minamata Convention on Mercury which is “ a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of mercury ”. India ratifies #MinamataConventiononMercury . Union Cabinet chaired by #PM #Modiji approved the proposal. It seeks to protect human health & environment from ill effects of Mercury. However, the Convention excludes use of Mercury in #Ayurvedic , #Siddha & #Unani medicines. pic.twitter.com/1ilj7REDN3 — Dr. Harsh Vardhan (@drharshvardhan) February 7, 2018 This Convention draws attention to widespread global mercury pollution due to human activities, such as mining and fossil fuel combustion, that releases this naturally occurring but toxic heavy metal from the earth’s crust. Although, mercury has broader electrical applications such as use in batteries and fluorescent lights, as well as, in meteorological equipment like barometers and thermometers. In India, it is also used in making traditional Indian medicines such as Ayurveda and Siddha. Furthermore, a recent study reported high mercury and arsenic content also present in traditional Chinese medicines ( Furuta and Sato, 2016 ). In an article , Sadhguru claims that, he can solidify and liquefy mercury by simply holding it in his hand and ‘energise’ it at room temperature. According to the Sadhguru, the benefits of such solidified mercury are related to people’s health, mental state and economics while referring to it as ‘subjective science’. “ Energising” mercury or any other material by “holding it” through a process called “consecration through divine reverberation”, mercury can be made “eternal” “When we energize a substance, we want the densest possible material that we can find. Mercury is one of the densest possible substances and it is in liquid form – it is the only liquid metal. Once you energize this, it will remain the same way for ten, fifteen thousand years. If the right kind of situation is maintained, it may remain that way for a hundred thousand years” The Sadhguru went on to further explain that: “It is because of this that most of the (shiva) lingas are mercury-based. The mercury lingas in the Theerthakunds are solidified mercury – 99.2% pure mercury – that 0.8% impurity is because laboratories are not capable of removing it. According to modern chemistry, you cannot solidify mercury at room temperature; you can solidify mercury only if you take it to -38 degrees Centigrade. But I will take it in my hand and solidify and liquefy it at room temperature. This is Indian alchemy and this is a way to energize any space. We have seen how for people who have taken solidified mercury forms into their homes, their health situation, their mental situations, even their economic situations, have changed phenomenally.” “ This whole science of solidifying and energizing mercury is called Rasa Vaidya. It is a subjective science, because if you have to change one thing into something else, you need some kind of addition, subtraction, change in temperature – you have to do something, otherwise it cannot happen. But now at room temperature, mercury is solidified without any addition. That cannot be physical, objective science. It has to be subjective science.” Even a basic school grade science textbook states that, under normal temperature and pressure conditions (NTP), i.e. 20°C (293.15 K, 68 °F) and an absolute pressure of 1 atm (14.696 psi, 101.325 kPa), pure mercury is indeed liquid . Pure mercury, even with its impurities, cannot exist as a solid state at NTP. The only way mercury can exist in a solid state is when combined with other elements as a chemical compound. This other element (e.g. sulphur) can exist as the other ion in the compound (HgS), not as an impurity. With the two oxidative states, mercury can bind with other elements such as oxygen and sulphur to become a solid at room temperature and pressure (NTP). Interestingly, the most common source of solidified mercury in nature is a rock called cinnabar which is a compound with mercury and sulphur- HgS . Structurally, a rocky crystalline compound, mercury (II) sulphide is dimorphic, with its optically active α form (red) and black β form. It can be mined in most geographical locations that extracts minerals, and has been used for thousands of years to extract mercury. It is through this kind of mining that mercury is spreading to become a global pollutant in the ecosystem. In the same article of Sadhguru highlighting the importance of mercury in Ayurveda and Siddha, he claimed that it is imperative for Siddha to contain mercury . Also, he claimed that severe illnesses are cured by placing ‘solidified’ mercury on the body. “Indian systems of medicine like Ayurveda and Siddha Vaidya use mercury on a daily basis. Siddha Vaidya cannot operate without mercury. Mercury is the most essential ingredient in Siddha Vaidya and also in some Ayurvedic products. This practice has been on for thousands of years. Consumption of mercury is very much a part of yogic practice. We know what it does to the system. In India, you will see people wearing mercury balls around their neck. There are any number of people who have come out of very serious immunological diseases just by having a piece of solidified mercury on their body.” Siddha medicine: one of the forms of ancient Indian traditional medicine systems, emerging from ancient region of the southern India (broadly, today’s Tamil Nadu and its surrounding geographical region). It is the ‘S’ in the AYUSH ( A yurverda, Y oga, U nani, S iddha and H omeopathy) of traditional Indian medicines, promoted heavily as a mainstream medicine system by the current government of India and also has its own Ministry of AYUSH , independent of the Ministry of Health and Welfare . In India, processes that includes mercury usage and addition not only exists in industrial electrical manufacturing, but also in Ayurveda, Siddha & Unani medicines. Since, the Minamata Convention seeks to protect human health & environment from adverse effects of Mercury, it excludes the use of Mercury in Ayurvedic, Siddha & Unani medicines . This decision was endorsed by the Union environment minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan along with the decision of the Cabinet. If the traditional Indian medical practice of Siddha, is essentially reliant on the use of mercury, then the toxicity and dosage of these drugs in humans needs to be questioned by the scientific principles of modern research. In 2002, Broussard and his colleagues published a meta-analysis of various mercury toxicity studies to conclude that mercury ions produce toxic effects by protein precipitation, enzyme inhibition, and generalized corrosive action. The article also discussed mechanisms of various routes of exposure, i.e. air, water and food and its threshold limits as well as symptoms of acute and chronic exposure. Evidently, naturally occurring mineral ore of mercury, such as Cinnabar , is also toxic and this toxicity was even found in the ancient Roman Empire ( P. Wexler, 2014 & R. J. Myers, 1986 ) and confirmed with modern medicine ( H.Y. Son, et al. 2010 ). A research article in 2008 that documented the amount of mercury and other heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, tin in larger than the maximum allowable content was published by Dr. Robert B. Saper , MD, MPH, Department of Family Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine. Although, these drugs contain small quantities of mercury, human body only needs small quantities to have a long lasting irreversible neurological damage . Saper’s article quoted above that profiled several Ayurveda drugs and suggested that the ingestion levels of substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic to be well above the permissible limit in both adults and children, if those Ayurveda drugs were consumed according to the recommended dosage of the manufacturers. In the same study by Saper (2008) , a figure stated that , 20% of the tested Ayurvedic drugs contained heavy metals and 9% contained mercury out of the 70 drugs tested . The list below gave the names of some drug manufacturers in India whose formulations contains high doses of heavy metals.. There have been cases of poisoning with mercury globally that has led to a major worldwide ban. It is estimated that more than 75,000 newborns in the United States each year may have increased risk of learning disabilities associated with in-utero exposure to methylmercury. There are several reports from WHO on hazardous substances that highlight the ill effects of mercury on human health. Several incidents have been widely reported about consuming mercury based traditional medicines leading to health issues. In 2015, a 55-year-old woman from Hamburg was found with “ record” levels of the toxic heavy metals in her body after using Ayurvedic medicines prescribed to her while staying for a week at a spa hotel in Sri Lanka. She brought the medicines back with her to Germany and continued to take them for weeks until she collapsed in July and was rushed to hospital suffering from severe neurological damage. Tobias Meyer, chief physician of Nephrology at the Asklepios Clinic Barmbek in Hamburg, treated the woman and said that the medicine contained 566,110 times the allowed level of mercury. The woman had swallowed a total of 213g of mercury , according to an analysis by the Hamburg Central Institute for Occupational and Maritime Medicine. In 2016 in Kerala, another young woman was given a Siddha medication for her skin problem, until her limbs were paralysed . Another medication was given for this new paralysis, essentially a side-effect of the medication misdiagnosed as rheumatism, until allegedly, 80% of her nerves had been damaged. According to mercury study report to congress in the USA by the National Service Centre for Environmental Publications (NSCEP), it can even be directly absorbed through direct contact with bare, or in some cases (methylmercury) insufficiently protected skin. Mercury, in any form, is dangerously hazardous to humans, where the quantity can be amplified through the food chain- in a process called bio-magnification by consuming food (e.g. fish and plants) and medication containing mercury. Since, the absorption of mercury is 90% via the gastrointestinal tract and produces rapid effect with higher toxicity, it is particularly dangerous in children.. In children, the effects of low dose prenatal mercury exposure can be dangerous in respect to cognition such as motor activity, attention, visuospatial changes, language and memory (see figure above) In this article, we examined various claims by Sadhguru regarding usage of mercury in Indian traditional medicines such as Siddha. The peer reviewed scientific literature on mercury clearly establishes its toxicity when ingested or absorbed. Moreover, there are several incidents that have been reported in relation to mercury toxicity, causing direct harm to human health, specifically in relation to the usage of traditional medications. The Union cabinet of India approves the ratification of Minamata Convention on mercury to ban its usage. Sadhguru (Isha foundation) endorses mercury use in Ayurveda and Siddha medicines. Sadhguru indulges in pseudoscience on mercury where he claims he can convert it to solid from liquid by ‘simply holding it in his hand’. Basic chemistry of mercury: Pure Hg is liquid while compounds such as HgS is a naturally occurring solid, both neurotoxic. Globally, mercury pollution occurs through mining and fossil fuel combustion, while in India, ingestion of traditional medicines containing mercury is widespread. Siddha and Ayurveda drugs contains toxic mercury and other heavy metals higher in quantity than the maximum permissible limit (Saper, 2008). Incidents with mercury toxicity reported post-consumption of Ayurveda and Siddha drugs that led to severe neurological damage and paralysis in adults, effects worse in children. From the perspective of modern scientific research, it is evident that mercury is dangerously toxic in all forms including its usage in traditional medicine. On the 8th of February 2018, Yogi Sadhguru from the Isha foundation tweeted that: “Responsible usage of mercury for medicinal and yogic purposes must be allowed. Indian Alchemy is largely mercury based and losing it to uninformed paranoia will be a great loss to humanity.” This statement was made following 7th of February 2018, when the Union Cabinet, India agreed to approve the enactment of the ban on mercury as part of the Minamata Convention on Mercury which is “a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from the adverse effects of mercury”.

https://www.altnews.in/dangerous-ayush-practitioners-prescribe-modern-medicine/,Why is it dangerous for AYUSH practitioners to prescribe modern medicine?,https://i0.wp.com/www.altnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bridge-fi.png?resize=300%2C158&ssl=1,2018-01-13 16:31:29,2018-01-25 11:37:43,"On October 25th, 2017, a pair of quacks running a hospital were held on charges of medical negligence after a woman died in their facility. Later, on November 15th, 2017,...",,"AltNews studied the NMC, 2017 bill to access the implications of the clause 49 that actualised a crossover between modern medicine practices and practices such as homeopathy and Ayurveda conducted by an “AYUSH Practitioner”. The clause 49 provides for joint sittings of the Commission, Central Councils of Homeopathy and Indian Medicine to enhance interface between their respective systems of medicine. Such meeting shall be held at least once a year. The joint sitting may reside on approving educational modules to develop bridges across the various systems of medicine and promote medical pluralism. – NMC, 2017 In particular clause 49 (4) suggests … a joint sitting… to decide on approving specific bridge course that may be introduced for the practitioners of Homeopathy and of Indian systems of Medicine to enable them to prescribe such modern medicines at such level as may be prescribed. Under the National Rural Health Commission (NRHM), AYUSH practitioners provide services for essential family planning counselling, post-partum, paediatric and obstetric services such as Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA). However, if clause 49 of the NMC bill were to be ratified by the Parliament, such “AYUSH Practitioners” will be able to prescribe modern medicine of the allopathic category by studying a short bridging course following their homeopathy or an Indian medical degree. Despite the fact that the specific details of this bridge course haven’t been provided in the current bill, discussion on the development of such a course have been on the table since 2007 as per a press release by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and; later, envisaged in a 2015 meeting convened by the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India. National Senior Vice President IMA Dr Rajendra Airan, raised concerns over this bill that is seeking to replace MCI (Medical Council of India) with a new body to ostensibly benefit the medical profession. While Dr Airan suggests it is making way for diminished state regulation of private medical colleges, decreased representation of all 29 states and of universities and medical education in the NMC, allowing foreign graduates to practice in India without sufficient screening tests while introducing a licentiate exam for domestic medical graduates, reduced democracy in NMC memberships with the inclusion of bureaucrats and non-medical government administrators as non-elected members. More importantly, as an immediate health concern, Dr. Airan also considered crosspathy as a problematic clause in the bill. Alt News spoke with a number of modern medical doctors in India, specialising in the areas most responsible for mortality and serious illnesses such as endocrinology, cardiovascular diseases and infectious ailments to get their opinions on the provision of crosspathy. “AYUSH therapies such as homeopathy is symptom based diagnosis while modern medicine is evidence based.” Dr. Hiten Kareliya While speaking to Dr. Om Lakhani, an endocrinologist in Zydus hospital, Ahmedabad, he suggested how the government is trying to bandage the problem of shortage of rural doctors and not finding a solution to the problem. Moreover, he suggested how a democratic and equal representation of modern medicine doctors in the new medical association is required so such non-scientifically validated practices of ‘crosspathy’ are not actualised. While, Dr. Anand Ahuja, a cardiovascular specialist perceived it as discriminatory towards those living in the rural areas, where to overcome the increased demand of doctors against its ameliorated supply, these anti-rural methods are being pushed. Moreover, Dr. Ahuja raised concerns about those seeking AYUSH treatments that may not be eligible for insurance claims. As discussed, medical insurance providers only provide claim to those seeking treatments from an evidence based practice. Even stem cell therapy, which is based on a scientific principle but not always a guaranteed success is excluded from such claims. Thirdly, Dr. Ahuja perceived that passing such bills can dilute the reputation of Indian doctors overseas. Since a large majority of doctors practicing modern medicine are based in the western countries, diluting the standard of medical practitioners by introducing a crossover of AYUSH and modern medicines can be detrimental for Indian doctors in the West and also for those seeking overseas medical experience. While Dr. Ahuja didn’t comment on the extent of competency of homeopathic or Ayurveda principles of treatment, he stated, “ The bridge course won’t be good enough to bridge the gap between the principles of modern medicine and other therapies, which is so wide apart. No course can possibly be sufficient to make anyone trained in one stream good enough to practise the other. ” Furthermore, he claimed that the AYUSH practitioners are trained completely differently when it comes to pharmacology and can make life threatening mistakes if allowed to prescribe medications. Certain health risks highlighted during our conversation were the prescription of Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, some of the most common prescription in the cardiovascular area- overdose or underdose of which, can cause serious problems affecting blood pressure and heart health. As infectious diseases such as TB are one of the major causes of mortality in India, we discussed with Dr. Hiten Kareliya, an infectious disease specialist at Prime Infection Care, Vadodara, to discuss the implications of these practitioners prescribing anti-biotics. He raised concerns about over or under treatment with antibiotics that can introduce anti-biotic resistant strains of bacteria in the communities and hospital settings that will then fail to respond of other forms of antibiotic treatments. He also raised similar issues around training of AYUSH practitioners and modern doctors that apply completely different methods to check, diagnose and investigate patients. Important issues can arise especially during infectious complications such as cerebral malaria, meningitis, HIV, pneumonia and sepsis where doctors decide on which tertiary care is required at its earliest- something that the AYUSH practitioners would not be able to refer to. Also, Dr. Kareliya was concerned about their lack of knowledge in modern pharmacology and its implications on dosage and side effects. “AYUSH therapies such as homeopathy is symptom based diagnosis while modern medicine is evidence based”. If poorly treated, such patients could be carriers of diseases such as typhoid and ameobiosis that could infect the larger population. Lastly, in cases such as TB, HIV and malignant tumours, prognosis and counselling is crucial. If these practitioners are not aware of drug pharmacodynamics and drug adherence, they will not be able to provide proper prognosis. In his opinion, Dr. Kareliya suggested the bridge course should be 2-3 years with internship in a public or corporate hospital to be eligible for prescribing modern medicine. One particular department of AYUSH which is discussed below, i.e. homeopathy, which is, in some cases, successfully used to treat diseases and a comparison against the modern medical practices evidently suggests how different its principles and mechanism of action can be. In the 17th century, Samuel Christian Hahnemann , a German physician unable to find answers with the limited understanding of modern medicine as it existed then, invented Homeopathy. This invention was before the systematic pharmacological study of drug safety and efficacy existed, before the knowledge of anatomy and physiology in its present form, microbiology and the germ theory of disease, before the invention of general anaesthesia (chloroform was discovered in 1831) or aseptic techniques and their uses in surgery. After multiple failed experiments, he stumbled upon quinine containing cinchona tree bark discovered before 1570s as a muscle relaxant. He later used it to treat malaria and developed malaria like symptoms, oblivious to the other side effects and contraindications of this drug he developed the first law of homeopathy. The Law of Similia Similibus Curentur ( Let likes be cured by likes) Also called the Law of Similitude : drugs causing symptoms that mimic a specific disease can be used to treat diseases that causes the same symptoms. 2. The Law of Single Remedy states that a prescription shouldn’t be given of more than one remedy at one point of time. If that doesn’t work, one should move on to the next remedy. If multiple treatments are given at the same time, it becomes difficult to conclude which one treated the condition. 3. The Law of Minimum Dose states that one should take the smallest dose to nudge one’s vital force to start the healing process. Hahnemann believed that healing should be “rapid, gently and permanent.” To use too much of a remedy frequently causes an aggravation of symptoms before any improvement is seen, thereby putting the individual off the modality 4. The Law of Direction of Cure states that If a disease is left untreated it moves in the opposite direction 5. The Law of Infinitesimal Doses Under this law, homeopathy claims that when drugs such as an extract from the chinchona tree bark is diluted in water or alcohol, they increase their therapeutic potential. This is conducted by a serial dilution process such that a 1:100 dilution, i.e. one mL of drug per 100 mL of water or alcohol is repeated from 6 to 30 times to produce the most potent drug. In between each such dilution process, the liquid is agitated violently- a process that claims to activate the drug properties. By this law, the minimum amount of potent homeopathy drug in the diluted liquid will be 1:100 ration repeated 6 times that will yield a maximum drug content with the ratio of 1:1000000000000 This means that a batch of 10,00,00,00,00 Litres of drug will contain only 1 mL of the actual drug compound, while the rest will be either water or alcohol. This diluted liquid, mostly water or alcohol is poured over small glucose balls that are to be consumed several times a day. A practice of validation through repetition of 4-5 doses a day, that may induce a placebo like effect- something that may be holding the value of homeopathy till this date. Several highly reputable scientific journals such as the list below have published studies that confirm time and again that the homeopathy method of treatment may work as placebo and there may not be any scientific basis for it. Shang, Aijing, et al . “Are the clinical effects of homeopathy placebo effects? Comparative study of placebo-controlled trials of homeopathy and allopathy.” The Lancet 366.9487 (2005): 726-732. Conclusion: Biases are present in placebo-controlled trials of both homeopathy and conventional medicine. When account was taken for these biases in the analysis, there was weak evidence for a specific effect of homoeopathic remedies, but strong evidence for specific effects of conventional interventions. This finding is compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects. Nuhn, Tobias, Rainer Lüdtke, and Max Geraedts . “Placebo effect sizes in homeopathic compared to conventional drugs–a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.” Homeopathy 99.1 (2010): 76-82. Conclusion: Placebo effects in RCTs on classical homeopathy did not appear to be larger than placebo effects in conventional medicine. Also, the Australian NHMRC, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, after analysing over 1800 scientific papers has concluded that homeopathy “relies on super-diluted substances” and has given the final verdict on the ineffectiveness of homeopathy as a treatment based on evidence based practice in a variety of clinical conditions. In essence, it concluded that there is no scientific basis for homeopathy and no quality evidence of its efficacy. Also, Homeopathy also has the theory of disease with three miasms, which are responsible for all human diseases and the treatments should be directed at treating these problematic miasms as a root cause: SYCOSIS: conditions worsened by damp weather and the sea. SYPHILIS: diseases of the nervous system such as a range of psychological illnesses such as alcoholism, depression, loss of sensations, ulcerations; the blood and skeletal disorders like heart conditions etc PSORA: diseases of a chronic nature, all skin diseases, mental illness other than syphilitic ones, allergies, varicose veins, haemorrhoids, most dysfunctional diseases of organs and systems, etc. Hence, each symptom is addressed instead of looking at the root cause of treatment- which the homeopaths claim to treat. e.g. Pain is a symptom of many disorders from cancer, diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders to injury and trauma. Treating the pain will not address the diabetes in a diabetic neuropathy patient. Conclusion Understanding the basic principles of homeopathy in particular, the law of infinitesimal doses, it is clear that the medicine does not contain enough drug to treat any disorder, i.e. it either consists largely of water or alcohol poured over sugar balls. While thoroughly researched evidence based pharmacology suggests the optimum drug dosage in the body is a major contributing factor for drug efficacy. Therefore, according to the modern scientific explanation, these homeopathic drugs simply should not work based on a mechanism. Also, the inconsistent homeopathic efficacy in some ailments, as we observe in some patients, can only be attributed to its placebo effect. In India, the Ministry of AYUSH has a Central council for research in homeopathy (CCRH), a fully funded government body to conduct research in homeopathy- a research area that has been increasingly pushed into mainstream medical science since the ministry was formed in 2014. On October 25th, 2017, a pair of quacks running a hospital were held on charges of medical negligence after a woman died in their facility. Later, on November 15th, 2017, a 16 year old girl died following an injection administered by alleged quack in HD Kote Taluka in Karnataka. As of now, this practice of quackery, where non-medically trained practitioners, practicing modern medicine- is illegitimate and a punishable offence. However, with the introduction of the National Medical Commission Bill (NMC, 2017), practitioners from Homeopathy and Indian medical systems such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Yoga and Unani (AYUSH practitioners) could gain such legitimacy via new policies proposed through the NMC. 2017 NMC bill has a provision for a bridge course to enable AYUSH practitioners to practise modern allopathic medicine in a limited way specifically in rural areas, where there are reduced number of medical practitioners. This article explores how this provision in the 2017 NMC bill not only puts a large majority of rural India at health risk but also provides an opportunity to AYUSH practitioners to become a modern medicine practitioner using a ‘short cut’. AltNews studied the NMC, 2017 bill to access the implications of the clause 49 that actualised a crossover between modern medicine practices and practices such as homeopathy and Ayurveda conducted by an “AYUSH Practitioner”. The clause 49 provides for joint sittings of the Commission, Central Councils of Homeopathy and Indian Medicine to enhance interface between their respective systems of medicine. Such meeting shall be held at least once a year. The joint sitting may reside on approving educational modules to develop bridges across the various systems of medicine and promote medical pluralism. – NMC, 2017 In particular clause 49 (4) suggests …a joint sitting… to decide on approving specific bridge course that may be introduced for the practitioners of Homeopathy and of Indian systems of Medicine to enable them to prescribe such modern medicines at such level as may be prescribed. Under the National Rural Health Commission (NRHM), AYUSH practitioners provide services for essential family planning counselling, post-partum, paediatric and obstetric services such as Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA). However, if clause 49 of the NMC bill were to be ratified by the Parliament, such “AYUSH Practitioners” will be able to prescribe modern medicine of the allopathic category by studying a short bridging course following their homeopathy or an Indian medical degree. Despite the fact that the specific details of this bridge course haven’t been provided in the current bill, discussion on the development of such a course have been on the table since 2007 as per a press release by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and; later, envisaged in a 2015 meeting convened by the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India. National Senior Vice President IMA Dr Rajendra Airan, raised concerns over this bill that is seeking to replace MCI (Medical Council of India) with a new body to ostensibly benefit the medical profession. While Dr Airan suggests it is making way for diminished state regulation of private medical colleges, decreased representation of all 29 states and of universities and medical education in the NMC, allowing foreign graduates to practice in India without sufficient screening tests while introducing a licentiate exam for domestic medical graduates, reduced democracy in NMC memberships with the inclusion of bureaucrats and non-medical government administrators as non-elected members. More importantly, as an immediate health concern, Dr. Airan also considered crosspathy as a problematic clause in the bill. Alt News spoke with a number of modern medical doctors in India, specialising in the areas most responsible for mortality and serious illnesses such as endocrinology, cardiovascular diseases and infectious ailments to get their opinions on the provision of crosspathy. Insights from Indian modern medicine practitioners: “AYUSH therapies such as homeopathy is symptom based diagnosis while modern medicine is evidence based.” Dr. Hiten Kareliya While speaking to Dr. Om Lakhani, an endocrinologist in Zydus hospital, Ahmedabad, he suggested how the government is trying to bandage the problem of shortage of rural doctors and not finding a solution to the problem. Moreover, he suggested how a democratic and equal representation of modern medicine doctors in the new medical association is required so such non-scientifically validated practices of ‘crosspathy’ are not actualised. While, Dr. Anand Ahuja, a cardiovascular specialist perceived it as discriminatory towards those living in the rural areas, where to overcome the increased demand of doctors against its ameliorated supply, these anti-rural methods are being pushed. Moreover, Dr. Ahuja raised concerns about those seeking AYUSH treatments that may not be eligible for insurance claims. As discussed, medical insurance providers only provide claim to those seeking treatments from an evidence based practice. Even stem cell therapy, which is based on a scientific principle but not always a guaranteed success is excluded from such claims. Thirdly, Dr. Ahuja perceived that passing such bills can dilute the reputation of Indian doctors overseas. Since a large majority of doctors practicing modern medicine are based in the western countries, diluting the standard of medical practitioners by introducing a crossover of AYUSH and modern medicines can be detrimental for Indian doctors in the West and also for those seeking overseas medical experience. While Dr. Ahuja didn’t comment on the extent of competency of homeopathic or Ayurveda principles of treatment, he stated, “The bridge course won’t be good enough to bridge the gap between the principles of modern medicine and other therapies, which is so wide apart. No course can possibly be sufficient to make anyone trained in one stream good enough to practise the other.” Furthermore, he claimed that the AYUSH practitioners are trained completely differently when it comes to pharmacology and can make life threatening mistakes if allowed to prescribe medications. Certain health risks highlighted during our conversation were the prescription of Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, some of the most common prescription in the cardiovascular area- overdose or underdose of which, can cause serious problems affecting blood pressure and heart health. As infectious diseases such as TB are one of the major causes of mortality in India, we discussed with Dr. Hiten Kareliya, an infectious disease specialist at Prime Infection Care, Vadodara, to discuss the implications of these practitioners prescribing anti-biotics. He raised concerns about over or under treatment with antibiotics that can introduce anti-biotic resistant strains of bacteria in the communities and hospital settings that will then fail to respond of other forms of antibiotic treatments. He also raised similar issues around training of AYUSH practitioners and modern doctors that apply completely different methods to check, diagnose and investigate patients. Important issues can arise especially during infectious complications such as cerebral malaria, meningitis, HIV, pneumonia and sepsis where doctors decide on which tertiary care is required at its earliest- something that the AYUSH practitioners would not be able to refer to. Also, Dr. Kareliya was concerned about their lack of knowledge in modern pharmacology and its implications on dosage and side effects. “AYUSH therapies such as homeopathy is symptom based diagnosis while modern medicine is evidence based”. If poorly treated, such patients could be carriers of diseases such as typhoid and ameobiosis that could infect the larger population. Lastly, in cases such as TB, HIV and malignant tumours, prognosis and counselling is crucial. If these practitioners are not aware of drug pharmacodynamics and drug adherence, they will not be able to provide proper prognosis. In his opinion, Dr. Kareliya suggested the bridge course should be 2-3 years with internship in a public or corporate hospital to be eligible for prescribing modern medicine. History and principles of a traditional medical practice: One particular department of AYUSH which is discussed below, i.e. homeopathy, which is, in some cases, successfully used to treat diseases and a comparison against the modern medical practices evidently suggests how different its principles and mechanism of action can be. In the 17th century, Samuel Christian Hahnemann, a German physician unable to find answers with the limited understanding of modern medicine as it existed then, invented Homeopathy. This invention was before the systematic pharmacological study of drug safety and efficacy existed, before the knowledge of anatomy and physiology in its present form, microbiology and the germ theory of disease, before the invention of general anaesthesia (chloroform was discovered in 1831) or aseptic techniques and their uses in surgery. After multiple failed experiments, he stumbled upon quinine containing cinchona tree bark discovered before 1570s as a muscle relaxant. He later used it to treat malaria and developed malaria like symptoms, oblivious to the other side effects and contraindications of this drug he developed the first law of homeopathy. The Law of Similia Similibus Curentur (Let likes be cured by likes) Also called the Law of Similitude: drugs causing symptoms that mimic a specific disease can be used to treat diseases that causes the same symptoms. 2. The Law of Single Remedy states that a prescription shouldn’t be given of more than one remedy at one point of time. If that doesn’t work, one should move on to the next remedy. If multiple treatments are given at the same time, it becomes difficult to conclude which one treated the condition. 3. The Law of Minimum Dose states that one should take the smallest dose to nudge one’s vital force to start the healing process. Hahnemann believed that healing should be “rapid, gently and permanent.” To use too much of a remedy frequently causes an aggravation of symptoms before any improvement is seen, thereby putting the individual off the modality 4. The Law of Direction of Cure states that If a disease is left untreated it moves in the opposite direction 5. The Law of Infinitesimal Doses Under this law, homeopathy claims that when drugs such as an extract from the chinchona tree bark is diluted in water or alcohol, they increase their therapeutic potential. This is conducted by a serial dilution process such that a 1:100 dilution, i.e. one mL of drug per 100 mL of water or alcohol is repeated from 6 to 30 times to produce the most potent drug. In between each such dilution process, the liquid is agitated violently- a process that claims to activate the drug properties. By this law, the minimum amount of potent homeopathy drug in the diluted liquid will be 1:100 ration repeated 6 times that will yield a maximum drug content with the ratio of 1:1000000000000 This means that a batch of 10,00,00,00,00 Litres of drug will contain only 1 mL of the actual drug compound, while the rest will be either water or alcohol. Treatment effect and placebo theory This diluted liquid, mostly water or alcohol is poured over small glucose balls that are to be consumed several times a day. A practice of validation through repetition of 4-5 doses a day, that may induce a placebo like effect- something that may be holding the value of homeopathy till this date. Several highly reputable scientific journals such as the list below have published studies that confirm time and again that the homeopathy method of treatment may work as placebo and there may not be any scientific basis for it. Shang, Aijing, et al. “Are the clinical effects of homeopathy placebo effects? Comparative study of placebo-controlled trials of homeopathy and allopathy.” The Lancet 366.9487 (2005): 726-732. Conclusion: Biases are present in placebo-controlled trials of both homeopathy and conventional medicine. When account was taken for these biases in the analysis, there was weak evidence for a specific effect of homoeopathic remedies, but strong evidence for specific effects of conventional interventions. This finding is compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects. Nuhn, Tobias, Rainer Lüdtke, and Max Geraedts. “Placebo effect sizes in homeopathic compared to conventional drugs–a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.” Homeopathy 99.1 (2010): 76-82. Conclusion: Placebo effects in RCTs on classical homeopathy did not appear to be larger than placebo effects in conventional medicine.

In essence, it concluded that there is no scientific basis for homeopathy and no quality evidence of its efficacy. Treating symptoms not diseases Also, Homeopathy also has the theory of disease with three miasms, which are responsible for all human diseases and the treatments should be directed at treating these problematic miasms as a root cause: SYCOSIS: conditions worsened by damp weather and the sea. SYPHILIS: diseases of the nervous system such as a range of psychological illnesses such as alcoholism, depression, loss of sensations, ulcerations; the blood and skeletal disorders like heart conditions etc PSORA: diseases of a chronic nature, all skin diseases, mental illness other than syphilitic ones, allergies, varicose veins, haemorrhoids, most dysfunctional diseases of organs and systems, etc. Hence, each symptom is addressed instead of looking at the root cause of treatment- which the homeopaths claim to treat. e.g. Pain is a symptom of many disorders from cancer, diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders to injury and trauma. Treating the pain will not address the diabetes in a diabetic neuropathy patient.

While, we are not suggesting that all practices of AYUSH are quackery and that there is little scientific evidence associated with them; but, as a matter of fact, they are completely different to the modern medical practices and hence cannot be mixed together. Most importantly, these practices may work in instances where modern medicine do not have all the answers but they have to be looked as a complementary treatment, in addition to allopathy, and not in place of it.",Dr. Sumaiya Shaikh,,,1

Alt News have found that, both of these drugs have been released with insufficient clinical testing and have relied on pre-clinical animal testing for the majority of its claims. Moreover, contrary to the popular belief, in some patients, treatment with these Ayurvedic drugs have revealed a plethora of side effects; and, in contrast to its claims, have known to increase the blood glucose level to a dangerous high. Alt News’ Research Alt News examined the claims made by BGR34 and AYUSH82 using published scientific evidence available at Google Scholar and PUBMED . In the area of drug formulations, health practitioners use the clinical and academic research indexed by Google Scholar and PUBMED to verify and seek information regarding new drugs. As a corollary, the absence of scientific research information regarding various drugs in Google Scholar and PUBMED indicates lack of clinical research for those drugs. In addition to Google Scholar and PUBMED, Alt News also looked at the research databases available at the ministry of AYUSH and CCRAS as well as the patents’ database (applied, granted as well as rejected) for these drugs. Moreover, in regards to BGR34 and AYUSH82, Alt News spoke to: Dr. Om Lakhani, MD (Medicine), DNB (Endocrinology), SCE- Endocrinology (RCP, UK) Consultant Endocrinologist at Zydus Hospital, Ahmedabad Dr. A.K. Mangal, a Botanist and the Assistant Director (Pharmacognosy) of CCRAS, autonomous body of the Ministry of AYUSH that developed these drugs. In the course of this article, Alt News also refers to the research and writings of: Padmashri and President’s award winner Professor (Dr.) Anoop Misra, Director of Department of Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases, Fortis Hospitals, New Delhi Bhushan Patwardhan, Ayurvedic Practitioner, Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune BGR34 – Claims and effects BGR34, an Ayurvedic drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and claim s to have 34 vital phyto-constituent extracts and derivatives according to healing principles of Ayurveda that converts proinsulin to insulin. The drug also claims to produce nil side effects in comparison to Allopathic drugs. Promotion BGR34 is being manufactured by a private enterprise called AIMIL Pharmaceuticals which was awarded the AYUSH brand of the year in 2016 by the Union Minister of Agriculture, Purushottam Rupala. News channels such as News 24 and ABP news aired exclusive reports along with the speech by Mr. Modi to promote its benefits and cost-effectiveness that gave an impression of it being a miraculous drug BGR34 – Medical research This drug has been collectively developed by two CSIR laboratories, National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) and Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plant (CIMAP). Senior principal scientist of NBRI, Dr. AKS Rawat said that ‘BGR34 has been examined on animals and a scientific study has identified it safe and effective, with clinical studies demonstrating only 67% success’ . AIMIL Pharmaceuticals also claims that BGR34 drug is manufactured according to a scientifically-proven optimised formula . Despite the claims, Alt News found no scientific data such for human clinical trials regarding BGR34 in peer reviewed journals from PUBMED and Google scholar (accessed 25/07/17). Similarly, pre-clinical studies (e.g. tests in animal models of diabetes) were not found for this drug in PUBMED or Google scholar databases. Also, a search for patent application at the National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) yielded no results for this drug. One clinical trial was found registered to CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry – India) for BGR34 in November 2016 by Dr. BP Gupta of Aggarwal Dharmath Hospital society, New Delhi that showed no pharmacokinetic data indicating any experiments conducted but simply stated that the primary outcome of this trial ‘shows promising results’ in a brief summary . This means that the registered trial showed no results at all in numbers or graph as evidence for any studies that may have been conducted using prescribed scientific methods. The lack of scientific data and one domestic clinical trial registered with no data makes it impossible to validate the claims made vis-a-vis BGR34 and thus, raises questions regarding the integrity of these claims. BGR34 – Side effects Contrary to popular belief and Ayurveda claims, patients have reported gastric problems and severe allergies as a result of BGR34 treatment while others also claimed that it has simply been ineffective . Patients reported some side effects such as allergies, stomach burning and no change in sugar levels during the consumption of the drug. However, one may not be able to say for sure that these side effects occurred as a result of BGR34, and not due to a random event due to the absence of proper clinical trial. Although, a rigorous double blind placebo RCT (randomised control trial), an essential part to the drug development process, would give this information and more related to the safety and toxicity of the drug. More information on these RCTs in drug development industries can be found here . Here we enlist some of the reviews on BGR34’s Facebook page. BGR34 – Cost Alt News also found that the claim that BGR34 is cheaper than Allopathic drugs is misleading. BGR34 is promoted as a cheaper drug with a price point of Rs. 5/ tablet with the recommended dosage of two tablets twice a day with meals. That makes it 4 tablets a day and amounts to Rs 20 a day or Rs 600 a month . Whereas, a 50 year old widely prescribed drug Metformin is available at the starting price of Rs. 0.75 per 500 mg tablet from GENETICA (ARISTO) with the recommended dose between 500-2500 mg per day that can cost anywhere from Rs. 22.5 to Rs. 112.5 a month . IME9 (AYUSH82) Recently, central council for research in Ayurvedic sciences (CCRAS), an autonomous body of the Ministry of AYUSH promoted a second drug for diabetes called AYUSH-82. AYUSH-82 is sold with a brand name IME9. In a report by the Hindu newspaper, IME9 stock worth Rs. 20 lakh was seized by the state drugs controller under the Drugs and Magic Remedies Objectionable Advertisements Act-1954 that disallowed advertisements of cure for chronic illnesses like diabetes. AYUSH82 or IME9 In conversation with the Assistant Director (Pharmacognosy) of CCRAS Dr. A.K. Mangal, we were informed that CCRAS developed this drug in the name of AYUSH82 and later sold the distribution and manufacturing rights to Kudos laboratories , who later repackaged it as IME9. Moreover, according to Dr. Mangal and this report on CCRAS website , this formula has also been sold to many other companies all or some of which will eventually manufacture and distribute this formula using different names such as IME9. We found three websites actively promoting and selling this drug: http://www.ime-9.com/ http://www.ime9.in/ and http://www.ayush82.com/ As IME9 has failed to prominently state that it is actually a branded version of AYUSH82, health practitioners and patients have found it difficult to find research regarding IME9 as all the primary research has been done for AYUSH82 and not IME9. IME9 (AYUSH82) – Medical research IME9 (AYUSH82) claims to have been developed after double blind clinical human trial studies of more than 800 patients. Double blinding is a method by which the person conducting the study and the patient, both are oblivious to the drug being tested in order to avoid experimental bias. Despite the claims, Alt News found no such study involving more than 800 patients using PUBMED or Google scholar (accessed 25/07/17). Also, a search for patents on the CCRAS website also yielded no results for this drug . One review article was found, without any research data , referring to IME9 in researchgate (a social media platform for scientists) by Dr. B. Negi and contained no details about where or when it was published. IME9 (AYUSH82) herb combination study also not found Also, Kudos Laboratories claims that IME9 contains five main ingredients such as Karela, Jamun, Amra, Gudmar and Shilajeet, which has anti-diabetic properties but hasn’t been tested in a combination of these ingredients specific to AYUSH82 either by AYUSH or by anyone else. Also, the exact proportion of these ingredients is also not available – an important detail with respect to dosage information. There are several studies that have tested each ingredient or as one or more combinations of these drugs in rat diabetic models by several Indian and non-Indian herbalists. However, the contraindications such as mixing these ingredients together or the efficacy studies in human clinical trials have not been found (searched 26/07/17). IME9 – side effects As with BGR34 and its missing clinical trials, IME9 has also been associated with many consumer complaints. Contrary to the popular belief that herbal medicines do not produce side effects, some of these adverse reactions due to IME9 included constipation, blood discharge in stool , and in contrast to the claim of hypoglycaemia, increased blood sugar levels (as shown in the images and video below)– an effect that can be extremely dangerous for a diabetic patient. Another patient also reported the same increase in blood sugar as a result of IME9 treatments for just 15 day period where her fasting blood glucose increased from 324 mg/dl to 460 mg/dl (normal range 70-110). Expert Opinions: From Ayurveda experts and endocrinologists Ayurvedic practitioner B Patwardhan Bhushan Patwardhan, Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune rejected the claims of these drugs and published his review in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine as below: The Government regulations, oversight and surveillance is required to ensure that gullible patients are not exploited. What is being sporadically done under the pretext of herbal drug development is certainly not in line with the basic principles, ethos and practice of Indian traditions. The AYUSH community has responsibility to preserve legacy and ensure that its credibility is not compromised for cheap publicity or short term economic gains. In a long run such inept efforts can erode credibility and likely to bring disrepute to Indian traditions and knowledge heritage. 2. Award winning Indian endocrinologist Prof. (Dr.) Anoop Misra In a Lancet paper , Prof. Anoop Misra and colleagues challenged the hype of alternative therapies for diabetes in India being developed. The team also found literature pertaining to these treatments but suggested that there were several methodological problems with these trials. Prof. Misra wrote, ‘Not only did the studies conducted faulty trials, but there could be severe dangers related to toxicity and interactions between the potential bioactive ingredients quoting the policy and guidelines suggested by the Central drugs standard control organisation, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Professor Misra also stated that ‘ the Indian guidelines have waived or relaxed the rules for rigorous pharmacological and toxicology studies for Ayurvedic products, provided that medicines are “prepared in same way as mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic treatises” such as Charaka Samhita or similar texts, purported to have been written and rewritten between the 6th century BCE and the 1st century CE ’, which presumably, is the reason enough to accept sub-standard drug trials conducted by AYUSH and its associated research centres. 3. A practicing endocrinologist Dr. Om Lakhani In a phone conversation with Dr. Om Lakhani, MD, a Consultant Endocrinologist at Zydus Hospital and MD Internal Medicine (Gold Medalist), DNB (Endocrinology), he also refuted the ‘miraculous’ claims of both of these anti-diabetic medications. He also commented on how the scientific basis for these medications is lacking and suggested it may be against the law to promote medicines and ‘miracle cures’ on TV, Radio or newspaper according to the ‘ Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954’ in India. He has also written a detailed review about these drugs here . 4. Furthermore , Saper et al (2008) tested and reported high levels of lead, mercury and arsenic in 1/5th of US and Indian manufactured medicines sold on the internet by testing a randomised selection of Ayurvedic drugs across 25 different websites. This research indicates that a large proportion of locally manufactured drugs can be contaminated which emphasizes a greater need for rigorous testing. Responsibility in drug efficacy and safety Should the ministry of AYUSH, CSIR laboratories, National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) and Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plant (CIMAP) be held accountable for violating these regulations and releasing these drugs without sufficient tests? Or should companies such as Kudos Laboratories be held accountable for promoting these drugs on television for the gullible patients? If the alternative Ayurvedic medicines developed and promoted by AYUSH and its associated laboratories have such adverse side effects due to inadequate testing in human models, is it really worth taking the risk? Especially when there can be life threatening side effects, misleading claims that comes with a greater cost in comparison to the best available treatment on the market. Conclusion Based on the current scientific data, expert opinions from the field and consumer complaints, there is scant scientific evidence for the use of BGR34 and AYUSH82 in the management of diabetes. These drugs may or may not work in type 2 diabetes , and would unlikely be of any use to type 1 diabetes due to a completely different pathology. Moreover, they is not evidence for toxicity tests in these drugs which are required, since there is evidence for contamination of lead, mercury and arsenics. There are also contraindication studies required to check whether these drugs interact with other drugs in the system. In November 2014, the Modi govt. created a new ministry called the AYUSH, which stands for the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy, with Shripad Yesso Naik appointed as the AYUSH minister of state (Independent Charge). Under UPA govt., AYUSH existed in the form of a department under the Health Ministry called the Department of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy (ISM&H). This upgrade to the ministry status also signaled an increased focus on research in alternative medicines. The ministry of AYUSH has helped develop, in collaboration with CSIR and CCRAS, two Ayurvedic anti-diabetic drugs namely BGR34 and AYUSH82 (sold as IME9). Alt News have found that, both of these drugs have been released with insufficient clinical testing and have relied on pre-clinical animal testing for the majority of its claims.

One clinical trial was found registered to CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry – India) for BGR34 in November 2016 by Dr. BP Gupta of Aggarwal Dharmath Hospital society, New Delhi that showed no pharmacokinetic data indicating any experiments conducted but simply stated that the primary outcome of this trial ‘shows promising results’ in a brief summary. This means that the registered trial showed no results at all in numbers or graph as evidence for any studies that may have been conducted using prescribed scientific methods. The lack of scientific data and one domestic clinical trial registered with no data makes it impossible to validate the claims made vis-a-vis BGR34 and thus, raises questions regarding the integrity of these claims. BGR34 – Side effects Contrary to popular belief and Ayurveda claims, patients have reported gastric problems and severe allergies as a result of BGR34 treatment while others also claimed that it has simply been ineffective. Patients reported some side effects such as allergies, stomach burning and no change in sugar levels during the consumption of the drug. However, one may not be able to say for sure that these side effects occurred as a result of BGR34, and not due to a random event due to the absence of proper clinical trial. Although, a rigorous double blind placebo RCT (randomised control trial), an essential part to the drug development process, would give this information and more related to the safety and toxicity of the drug. More information on these RCTs in drug development industries can be found here. Here we enlist some of the reviews on BGR34’s Facebook page. BGR34 – Cost Alt News also found that the claim that BGR34 is cheaper than Allopathic drugs is misleading. BGR34 is promoted as a cheaper drug with a price point of Rs. 5/ tablet with the recommended dosage of two tablets twice a day with meals. That makes it 4 tablets a day and amounts to Rs 20 a day or Rs 600 a month. Whereas, a 50 year old widely prescribed drug Metformin is available at the starting price of Rs. 0.75 per 500 mg tablet from GENETICA (ARISTO) with the recommended dose between 500-2500 mg per day that can cost anywhere from Rs. 22.5 to Rs. 112.5 a month. IME9 (AYUSH82) Recently, central council for research in Ayurvedic sciences (CCRAS), an autonomous body of the Ministry of AYUSH promoted a second drug for diabetes called AYUSH-82. AYUSH-82 is sold with a brand name IME9. In a report by the Hindu newspaper, IME9 stock worth Rs. 20 lakh was seized by the state drugs controller under the Drugs and Magic Remedies Objectionable Advertisements Act-1954 that disallowed advertisements of cure for chronic illnesses like diabetes. AYUSH82 or IME9 In conversation with the Assistant Director (Pharmacognosy) of CCRAS Dr. A.K. Mangal, we were informed that CCRAS developed this drug in the name of AYUSH82 and later sold the distribution and manufacturing rights to Kudos laboratories, who later repackaged it as IME9. Moreover, according to Dr. Mangal and this report on CCRAS website, this formula has also been sold to many other companies all or some of which will eventually manufacture and distribute this formula using different names such as IME9. We found three websites actively promoting and selling this drug: http://www.ime-9.com/ http://www.ime9.in/ and http://www.ayush82.com/ As IME9 has failed to prominently state that it is actually a branded version of AYUSH82, health practitioners and patients have found it difficult to find research regarding IME9 as all the primary research has been done for AYUSH82 and not IME9. IME9 (AYUSH82) – Medical research IME9 (AYUSH82) claims to have been developed after double blind clinical human trial studies of more than 800 patients. Double blinding is a method by which the person conducting the study and the patient, both are oblivious to the drug being tested in order to avoid experimental bias. Despite the claims, Alt News found no such study involving more than 800 patients using PUBMED or Google scholar (accessed 25/07/17). Also, a search for patents on the CCRAS website also yielded no results for this drug. One review article was found, without any research data, referring to IME9 in researchgate (a social media platform for scientists) by Dr. B. Negi and contained no details about where or when it was published. IME9 (AYUSH82) herb combination study also not found Also, Kudos Laboratories claims that IME9 contains five main ingredients such as Karela, Jamun, Amra, Gudmar and Shilajeet, which has anti-diabetic properties but hasn’t been tested in a combination of these ingredients specific to AYUSH82 either by AYUSH or by anyone else. Also, the exact proportion of these ingredients is also not available – an important detail with respect to dosage information. There are several studies that have tested each ingredient or as one or more combinations of these drugs in rat diabetic models by several Indian and non-Indian herbalists. However, the contraindications such as mixing these ingredients together or the efficacy studies in human clinical trials have not been found (searched 26/07/17). IME9 – side effects As with BGR34 and its missing clinical trials, IME9 has also been associated with many consumer complaints. Contrary to the popular belief that herbal medicines do not produce side effects, some of these adverse reactions due to IME9 included constipation, blood discharge in stool, and in contrast to the claim of hypoglycaemia, increased blood sugar levels (as shown in the images and video below)– an effect that can be extremely dangerous for a diabetic patient. Another patient also reported the same increase in blood sugar as a result of IME9 treatments for just 15 day period where her fasting blood glucose increased from 324 mg/dl to 460 mg/dl (normal range 70-110). Expert Opinions: From Ayurveda experts and endocrinologists Ayurvedic practitioner B Patwardhan Bhushan Patwardhan, Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune rejected the claims of these drugs and published his review in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine as below: The Government regulations, oversight and surveillance is required to ensure that gullible patients are not exploited. What is being sporadically done under the pretext of herbal drug development is certainly not in line with the basic principles, ethos and practice of Indian traditions. The AYUSH community has responsibility to preserve legacy and ensure that its credibility is not compromised for cheap publicity or short term economic gains. In a long run such inept efforts can erode credibility and likely to bring disrepute to Indian traditions and knowledge heritage. 2. Award winning Indian endocrinologist Prof. (Dr.) Anoop Misra In a Lancet paper, Prof. Anoop Misra and colleagues challenged the hype of alternative therapies for diabetes in India being developed. The team also found literature pertaining to these treatments but suggested that there were several methodological problems with these trials. Prof. Misra wrote, ‘Not only did the studies conducted faulty trials, but there could be severe dangers related to toxicity and interactions between the potential bioactive ingredients quoting the policy and guidelines suggested by the Central drugs standard control organisation, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Professor Misra also stated that ‘the Indian guidelines have waived or relaxed the rules for rigorous pharmacological and toxicology studies for Ayurvedic products, provided that medicines are “prepared in same way as mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic treatises” such as Charaka Samhita or similar texts, purported to have been written and rewritten between the 6th century BCE and the 1st century CE’, which presumably, is the reason enough to accept sub-standard drug trials conducted by AYUSH and its associated research centres. 3. A practicing endocrinologist Dr. Om Lakhani In a phone conversation with Dr. Om Lakhani, MD, a Consultant Endocrinologist at Zydus Hospital and MD Internal Medicine (Gold Medalist), DNB (Endocrinology), he also refuted the ‘miraculous’ claims of both of these anti-diabetic medications. He also commented on how the scientific basis for these medications is lacking and suggested it may be against the law to promote medicines and ‘miracle cures’ on TV, Radio or newspaper according to the ‘Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954’ in India. He has also written a detailed review about these drugs here. 4. Furthermore, Saper et al (2008) tested and reported high levels of lead, mercury and arsenic in 1/5th of US and Indian manufactured medicines sold on the internet by testing a randomised selection of Ayurvedic drugs across 25 different websites. This research indicates that a large proportion of locally manufactured drugs can be contaminated which emphasizes a greater need for rigorous testing. Responsibility in drug efficacy and safety Should the ministry of AYUSH, CSIR laboratories, National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) and Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plant (CIMAP) be held accountable for violating these regulations and releasing these drugs without sufficient tests? Or should companies such as Kudos Laboratories be held accountable for promoting these drugs on television for the gullible patients? If the alternative Ayurvedic medicines developed and promoted by AYUSH and its associated laboratories have such adverse side effects due to inadequate testing in human models, is it really worth taking the risk? Especially when there can be life threatening side effects, misleading claims that comes with a greater cost in comparison to the best available treatment on the market. Conclusion Based on the current scientific data, expert opinions from the field and consumer complaints, there is scant scientific evidence for the use of BGR34 and AYUSH82 in the management of diabetes. These drugs may or may not work in type 2 diabetes, and would unlikely be of any use to type 1 diabetes due to a completely different pathology. Moreover, they is not evidence for toxicity tests in these drugs which are required, since there is evidence for contamination of lead, mercury and arsenics. There are also contraindication studies required to check whether these drugs interact with other drugs in the system. Lastly, a rigorous unbiased-multi-phase double blind clinical trial needs to be conducted in healthy as well as in type 2 diabetes patients of both genders, age groups, pregnancy, patients with other disorders, etc. before its market release before making such elaborate claims.",Dr. Sumaiya Shaikh,,,1

This is a true ocular emergency and requires immediate medical attention to avoid potential blinding and if not treated right, can irreversibly damage the eye surface and its anterior segment leading to visual deficits and disfigurement. In a village in Haryana, a fake doctor (quack) administered eye drops made from sedimented cow urine which was then boiled and mixed with soot ( Surma ) and applied using metal rod leading to pain and visual deficits. His ordeal lasted for 2 days before he decided to visit the Rohtak city ophthalmologist to avoid permanent loss of vision. Recently, due to the increased politicised bovine discussions occurring in reference to religion and food choices in India, bovine products such as milk and excretory urine and dung has attained a newly found value. This year, scientists in AIIMS, Delhi have received funding from the Indian Government to conduct research on the medicinal value of a bovine concoction called the Panchgaavya : a mixture of five substances the cow directly or indirectly produces, two of those being urine and faeces. In most serious public health departments, this category of research could be a part of parallel health study which is considered ‘complementary’ a’kin to homeopathy and acupuncture. Ideally, bearing in mind that the patient’s health isn’t at risk or presented symptoms are not worsened due to any given therapeutic approach, such as Allopathic, Ayurvedic, or Homeopathic: This complimentary treatment doesn’t constitute the only treatment the patient will receive and/or The patient will only receive if specific consent is taken in regards to which therapy is to be included, in addition to the mainstream medical treatment. Since the government has openly shown support and funded some of these programs as a part of its mainstream scientific research, increasing number of people and practitioners of non-evidence based medicine are drawn towards these practices. Instead of investing in scholarships for undergraduate medical courses, a charity in Kolkatta has introduced training programs for quacks that teaches them basic diagnosis. Their most common errors, says Dr Saibal Majumdar, who is in charge of the training centre, are using injections to induce labour; using IVF fluids unnecessarily; over-prescribing antibiotics; giving antibiotics for viruses; and lack of awareness about which drugs should not be given to pregnant women. In a case titled Poonam Verma vs Aswin Patel (AIR 1996, SC 2111) , the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has given a definition of quack as “ a person who does not have knowledge of a particular system of medicine but practices in that system is a quack and a mere pretender to medical knowledge” . In another decision by the Supreme Court of India in 2002, it was held that “a professional may be held liable for negligence on the ground that he did not possessed of the requisite skill which he professes to have”. Indian Medical Council act of 1956 provides that no person other than a medical practitioner enrolled on State Medical Register shall practice scientific medicine in any state of India. The form of rigorous research, as it exists in the major medical research labs, was not followed by people who documented ancient medical practices; Thus the perceived notion about cow products like urine and dung about them being completely harmless, since they are considered organic and natural, may be completely wrong. However, bearing in mind that many potent psychedelic drugs that contain dimethyltryptamine are made from natural products such as tree barks. Urinalysis shows that bovine urine, similar to its human counterpart, contains a large water component (91-96% varies on the hydration state of the body) and: Nitrogenous wastes like urea, uric acid and creatinine, Sodium and other organic salts Organic compounds, including proteins, hormones, and different metabolites If consumed, drug metabolites In diseased states, blood cells In some infections, pathogens like E.coli bacteria Excessive consumption of foods like beetroot may cause urine to contain the dye from the food Even if it is assumed that the bovine urine collected from the ‘gaushala’ is free of infectious diseases, ammonia on its own is considerably harmful. Pure ammonia is not advisable to be inhaled, let alone consumed or topically applied on skin or worse come in contact with skin mucosa like eyes, nose or the lining of the mouth. For chemists, it is no secret that ammonia is a strong alkaline and can erode skin surface. Hence, parts of it is converted to some of the lesser harmful substances like the urea and uric acids for a comparatively longer storage in the mammalian bladder. Although, science is in support of mammalian wastes for agricultural industries but the extensive effort to validate traditional medicine as shown in the studies below not only justifies the mainstream argument of cow related politics and the recent tragedies but places everyone else seeking medical treatment at great risk.

Sandeep, Garud, Chaudhary Anubha, and Kotecha Mita. “GO-MUTRA: BOON TO HUMAN BEINGS.” International Journal of Ayurveda and Pharma Research 4, no. 9 (2016). From the work of Pathak and Kumar published in 2003, there are two chief methods of cow urine formulation described in Ayurveda (Pathak ML, Kumar A. Gomutra-descriptive study. Sachit Ayurveda. 2003;7:81–84): Gaumutrasava: In this method cow urine is boiled in glass vessel to remove ammonia and then mixed with jaggery in ratio of 5:1. Gaumutra arka: This is the second method in which the vapors of cow urine are collected in a vessel as in distillation process. However in the above distillation process: Boiling urine to eliminate ammonia would do the reverse and concentrate ammonia unless the temperature is increased to the boiling point of ammonia, i.e. -33°C, (not obtained in ordinary conditions unless you live in the Himalayas, especially in ancient India) . There is also no mention of other nitrogenous wastes mainly, urea and uric acid which has separate melting (132.7º C) and boiling (300 °C) points respectively. Urea, a colourless crystal (solid) decomposes before boiling and the latter, uric acid is a white crystalline structure. Clearly, these scientific facts, only known in the 19 th century would be hard to take into consideration during the distillation process of urine in the ancient India a thousand years ago or more. Distillation on the other hand, was first discussed by Aristotle and later by the Greek chemists in the 1 st century AD ( Bryan H. Bunch; Alexander Hellemans (2004). The History of Science and Technology. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. p. 88 ). However, it was not until the 3 rd century when evidence in the form of sketches was found in the Greek manuscript of Byzantine Egypt called Parisinus graces ( https://archive.org/details/collectiondesanc01bert ). According to the analysis of Dr. Kandhuja and his colleagues , ‘it is possible that the retained ammonia in the urine could have caused ocular surface injury. Ammonia gas when dissolved in water forms an alkali ammonium hydroxide, which when in contact with the ocular surface leads to saponification and damage the corneal epithelium.’ Fortunately for the patient, upon worsening of his symptoms, he visited Dr. Sumeet Khanduja on time who is a faculty at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Rohtak, Haryana and was prescribed with oral analgesics (pain killers) and, topical moxifloxacin 0.5% (antibiotic), homatropine 2% (mydriatic: to dilate the pupil) and preservative free lubricating eye drops (to recover from dry, itchy eyes). A review of the case report by Khanduja et al. (2017) can be found here ¨A 24-year-old male presented with complaints of pain, difficulty in opening and blurred vision in both eyes for the last 48 hours.

It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021 , which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch . However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. A video of a set of iron nails that appear to melt after being placed on a black stone is viral on social media. It is claimed that this stone was found in Afghanistan. Viral messages claim that though the stone is cool from the outside, it can melt anything made of steel and iron when placed in contact. Twitter user @kabirkhan488 shared the clip with the same claim.

(Link 1, Link 2, Link 3) افغانستان کے صوبہ وردک میں ایک ایسا پتھر دریافت ہوا ھے جو اوپر سے ٹھنڈا ھے لیکن اگر اسٹیل یا لوہا اوپر رکھے تو پگھلاتا ھے۔۔ یہ کون سا پتھر ہو سکتا ہے pic.twitter.com/4sXl6w9LRL — Sajid Mehmood (@Sajid_Mehmood_5) November 28, 2021 Not a magical stone We performed a reverse image search using stills from the video, which led us to an article on a website called masralyoum.net. It quotes M. Majid Abu Zahra, founder of the Jeddah Astronomy Society, as saying that the nails shown in the footage are made up of a metal called gallium. Its low melting point of around 29ºC explains why it easily melts when brought into contact with the stone. The article also contains a link to a Facebook post dated November 27, 2021, which mentions that even sunlight easily melts galium when placed on a warm surface. With a keyword search, Alt News came across several such reports that verified other similar videos. For instance, an ABC10 news report from April 12, 2018. The video report mentions that the nail placed on the stone is made out of gallium, which has a melting point of 85.6°F. At this temperature, gallium can melt quite easily. It is worth noting that the average temperature of the human body is around 98.6°F, which means that this metal can melt simply from human touch. However, it remains solid at room temperature. It also has an extremely high (4044°F) boiling point. Apart from gallium, other metals like mercury, cesium, and rubidium are also in a liquid state at room temperature, which is why they are used in thermometers. Snopes also debunked a similar video in a fact-check report dated April 10, 2018. It stated that when steel and iron are melted, they turn blue and orange respectively. However, the colour of this metal remains the same even after it has liquefied. Another video explainer reported that the nails are made out of gallium. This confirms that the stone seen in the video is not magical. But the phenomenon seen in the video can be attributed to the nails being made of gallium, a metal with a low melting point of 85.6°F.",Kinjal,False,False,1

Police investigations have found that he created the threat letter in Arabic using Google translator. ‘Given his age, police said they are yet to decide about arresting him, and are considering various options’, said the Hindustan Times while no other arrests have been made. Research Publications Shukla claims that he has developed drugs for treatment of AIDS, malaria and heart diseases using plant extracts. A scientist, in particular, a medical scientist can claim original research on the basis of an established lab, their team, at least one peer review publication – which is an original research paper with a hypothesis, methods and results of the breakthrough – that may or may not result in a patent. However, the only original research Shukla has published on HIV (as an academic of the Department of Community Medicine and Public Health, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India) are the following two: High-risk sexual behavior among people living with HIV /AIDS attending tertiary care hospitals in district of Northern India. Shukla M , Agarwal M, Singh JV, Tripathi AK, Srivastava AK, Singh VK. Indian J Sex Transm Dis. 2016 Jan-Jun; 37(1):46-51. doi: 10.4103/0253-7184.176212. Nonadherence to Antiretroviral Therapy Among People Living with HIV /AIDS Attending Two Tertiary Care Hospitals in District of Northern India.

In the 1st paper, Shukla and his colleagues interviewed 322 HIV-positive patients about their sexual behaviours during last 3 months using a pre-tested questionnaire that resulted in the following conclusion : ‘ Specific intervention addressing alcohol consumption and encouragement of spouse and family support should be integrated in the routine HIV/AIDS care and treatment apart from HIV transmission and prevention knowledge.’ In the 2 nd paper, in a similar manner, they interviewed 322 HIV-positive patients (perhaps the same patients interviewed in the 1 st paper) that were already undergoing an established and trialled Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) used since decades to combat HIV symptoms and slowing down of the infection process. No such treatment is created that can result in complete elimination of HIV in humans. In Shukla’s 2 nd paper, they studied the adherence of these 322 patients to ART, and reported that ‘A total of 10.9% of patients were found to be non-adherent to ART. Principal causes cited were being busy with other work (40.0%), felt sick or ill (28.5%), not having money (14.2%), and being away from home (11.4)’ which was the principle aim of this study – To observe what makes these patients skip treatments instead of finding a cure. The above stated conclusion of the 1 st research article and the result of the 2 nd paper doesn’t need a scientific eye to determine that that is no plant based or other treatment ‘developed’ in his lab that the ISIS may want to acquire. Patents Generally, a patent, is backed up by many trials and clinical findings that are reported in established medical journals such as Nature, Lancet, Science and others, that allow to verify and question the authenticity of the work by other scientists in the same field before its publication. In Shukla’s case, his patent has been filed under the following title: Bioactive composition for the treatment of the HIV/AIDS, method for manufacturing and using the same – US 8431153 B2 The claim is for developing a mixture of specific quantities of the following compounds Curcumin (10%-30% w/w), cyperone (15%-45% w/w), ursolic acid (15%-35% w/w), vinfluine (5% w/w); and berberin sulfate (no detail) Highlighting the specific details of this patent is: The claim of mixing the desired amounts which the primary ingredient being curcumin (multiple patents exists on this ingredient found in turmeric/haldi with several researchers studying its anti-inflammatory properties). The patent nowhere suggests the invention of these ingredients The wide range of active ingredient per unit (w/w) highlights the arbitrariness of the bioactive solution that contain curcurmin from 10g to 30g in a 100g sample. Lastly, and more importantly, the patent is based on the clinical trials conducted on 76 patients but the results of only 6 were given in the patent summary without adequate information other than the drug had no side effects. Moreover, these findings were not found published anywhere in Dr. Shukla’s name that raises questions to the legitimacy of these clinical trials. Our research suggested this patent was linked to the drug called OJAK was sold with other herbal medicines under the company AYUSHI BIOTECH whose sole proprietor is Mukesh Shukla. Mainstream news as core evidence for scientific legitimacy In 2013, in an attempt for promotion of research, India MedicalTimes and DNAIndia published two news stories on Dr. Shukla’s medical breakthroughs. A blog post or a mainstream news report, where peer-review is an unlikely process, scientific claims for medical treatments are deemed as quackery in evidence based practise. Although such interviews to news channels are a legitimate method of research promotion for scientists in India and abroad, having no other legitimate scientific publications poses serious threats to the integrity of the scientific community and doctors and their body of work, on the basis of which traditional and western medications are prescribed. More importantly, questions are raised where doctors or scientists endorse such products that directly benefit them as a part of a proprietorship. A thorough analysis of these research articles, patents and the company profile suggests Dr. Shukla’s ongoing interest in the field of bioactive ingredient for HIV treatment – Which hasn’t resulted in a scientifically legitimised treatment, unless the cause of this promotion in the form of a cooked up ISIS attack story is the need to market drugs like OJAK. Dr. Mukesh Harilal Shukla, who claims to have studied B.Com (HA College of Commerce, Ahmedabad), and later an MD and PhD in Alternative Medicines (see the prerequisite for these courses here) is a bio-herbal research scientist based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. On the 22nd of April 2017, he claimed that he received death threats from the Islamic State (ISIS/Da’ish) in an Arabic letter seeking the formula of his alleged ‘patented’ drug against HIV infections, and was subsequently attacked by pepper spray and robbed off Rs 24,000 cash. Since then the police has been giving him protection. A week later, on the 29th of April 2017, the police said he fabricated this story of attack for publicity of his research. Police investigations have found that he created the threat letter in Arabic using Google translator. ‘Given his age, police said they are yet to decide about arresting him, and are considering various options’, said the Hindustan Times while no other arrests have been made.

As a medical scientist, I am uncertain whether studying Dr. Shukla’s other claims in the area of malaria, liver dysfunction or leukaemia disorders is worth a shot – something that is a part of a scientist’s job in the peer review process – to carefully study, validate and give credits to each other’s work. This is to maintain integrity, legitimacy and an almost unselfish desire to do good to humans in the process of relieving them of pathological misery in exchange for satisfaction, esteem and a decent salary that pays the bills. However, I hope, capitalistic gains in businesses or even worse, using religion and hate for self-promotion is never a part of a scientist’s profile.",Dr. Sumaiya Shaikh,,False,1
