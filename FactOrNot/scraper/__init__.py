        article_claim ='Several social media users have posted an image of a minor girl and claimed that her burnt clothes were found at AAP councillor Tahir Hussain’s residence. The claim adds that the girl’s naked corpse was found in a drain connected to his house. “She has been identified,” it alleges.'
        textcontent = '[Translated from #ताहिर #हुसैन के आतंक की फैक्ट्री घर से जिस लड़की के कपड़े बरामद हुवे थे और बदन पर एक कपड़ा भी नही था उसकी नाले में लाश मिली थी उसकी पहचान हो चुकी है]. In order to protect the identity of the minor, Alt News has not attached the screenshots of the viral posts. Several right-wing media websites such as Hindu Post (archive link), Sirf News (archive link), Best Hindi News (archive link) and National Dunia (report deleted) also shared the viral image of the minor claiming that she was found in the drain near Hussain’s house. Incident from Madhya Pradesh falsely linked with Delhi riots Alt News performed a reverse image search of the girl’s photograph on Google along with appropriate keywords and found a February 21 report by Dainik Bhaskar. According to the report, a class 12 student was killed in a fire that broke out in her house when she was alone. The police speculated suicide after matchsticks were allegedly recovered from her residence. The girl’s family members however refuted the suicide angle. The incident took place in Parsuliya Kalan, a village in Susner tehsil of Madhya Pradesh.As per the article, the house burned down on February 20 however, SHO Susner Vivek Kanodi informed Alt News that the incident took place on February 19. Alt News performed another keyword search on YouTube and found a February 25 video by one Nitesh Sharma. At the 1:19 mark, Manish Jain, SDM Susner, stated that suspects named by the girl’s father are being interrogated and the forensics team is analysing if the victim was raped or not. In a telephonic conversation with Alt News, Sub Divisional Police Officer JP Rawat, who is a part of the special investigations team, said, “As per our investigation, the door was locked from inside. As a result, we suspect a case of suicide. However, the parents have named the boy next door as a suspect. We have arrested him and registered the case under abatement of suicide, section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. We are now waiting for forensic reports for further investigation.” When questioned if the case has any links with Tahir Hussani, the officer said, “Clearly there is no link with Delhi riots. There is no Hindu-Muslim angle to this case whatsoever.” Therefore several right-wing media outlets and social media users published a false and misleading claim about an incident from Madhya Pradesh and linked it with Delhi riots.'

Twitter user @ChaanchalMaurya posted (archive link) the viral image. It was retweeted over 5,000 times. Similarly, many Facebook and Twitter users have shared this image. FACT-CHECK Alt News performed a reverse image search on Yandex and found a YouTube video which carried the viral image. According to the video uploaded by Gracie Rosado in October 2014, the viral image was clicked by photographer Mark Edwards. After performing a keyword search, Alt News found the viral image on the website of Hard Rain Project, a charity founded by Edwards. The image was clicked by the photograher himself and it is described as, “Refugees from East Pakistan arriving in India during the Bangladesh war in 1971. The book ‘Body Horror: Photojournalism, Catastrophe and War’ by John Taylor also attributes Edwards for this image. While speaking with the website Rare Historical Photos (RHP) in August 2014, Edwards said, “I took this profoundly disturbing picture of a man carrying his cholera-stricken wife during the Bangladesh war in 1971. Ten million people crossed the East Pakistan (Bangladesh) border into India to escape the horrors of this bloody war.” As per several online sources, Bangladesh witnessed an outbreak of cholera in 1971. Alt News reached out to Edwards over email for more details. He informed, “I don’t know if she died from cholera or not but there was absolutely no indication she was raped.” The photograph is, therefore, circulating with baseless claims in the view of the recently-enacted Citizenship Amendment Act.'

While the juvenile’s name was not released, it was reported by the media. However, the photograph shows Vinay Sharma, one of the four adult convicts sentenced to death for the crime. It was published by The Hindu in August 2016. Sharma worked as an assistant at a gym, and had tried to commit suicide in 2016. It may be recalled that four of the five convicts in the Nirbhaya case have been sentenced to death, whereas the juvenile convict in the case was handed three years imprisonment for the crime by a juvenile court. The photograph shared on social media, however, does not represent the juvenile convict but an adult convict of the Nirbhaya case, Vinay Sharma.'

We found that the same video had been uploaded in March 2013 on YouTube by a user with the title ‘Muslims attacked 76 Hindu families and 5 Temples in Noyakhali, Bangladesh.Communal violence had erupted in Noakhali, Bangladesh in March 2013 after an Islamist leader had been sentenced to death by a special tribunal over war crimes committed during the war of independence in 1971. A report by the BBC states, “The attack started hours after a senior hardline Islamist leader was sentenced to death by a special tribunal in late February. Jamaat-e-Islami party Vice President Delwar Hossain Sayedee was given a death sentence for crimes committed during the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.” The report mentioned that after the verdict was announced, supporters of the party went on a rampage, targeting the Hindu and Buddhist communities. 60 people were killed in clashes with security personnel. An old incident from Bangladesh was falsely and maliciously shared as recent communal violence in Rajasthan following the assembly election. Disinformation as a weapon for political propaganda continues to be wielded even after polling has ended, and in most such instances, the Congress party is at the receiving end.'

In this open letter, he has lashed out at Arnab Goswami for what he claims is highly unethical journalism. We spoke to Mr MB Rajesh and he told us that he was forced to write this open letter after his appearance on a show in Republic TV. He claims that he was not only invited for an entirely different topic originally, but even when he agreed to participate in the show whose topic was changed at the last minute, he was not allowed to express his views on the issue. After the show, he claims that the Sangh Parivar in Kerala started circulating a clipped version of the show as part of their propaganda. “Then I realized the need to counter the propaganda and I wrote the open letter“, Mr MB Rajesh told Alt News.He also stated that Arnab’s claims of CPI (M) not respecting Indian Army is absolutely false. “I am myself the son of a retired Army Havildar who fought in the 1971 war. I was born in Army Hospital, Jalandhar. I was born in 1971 and was only a few months old when the 1971 India-Pakistan war broke out. My mother told me many stories about how the family including my father were in Tamil Nadu for a ceremony after my birth and my father received a telegram and had to urgently leave for Jalandhar. My father is alive and he’s extremely proud of his service in the Indian Army“, stated Mr MB Rajesh.'
        textcontent = 'A clip from Republic TV\’s show in which MB Rajesh participated can be seen below. The full text of Mr MB Rajesh’s letter is reproduced here. അർണാബ്‌ ഗോസ്വാമിക്ക്‌ അയച്ച കത്തു ഇവിടെ എല്ലാവർക്കുമായി പങ്കുവെക്കുന്നു.(An open letter to Arnab Goswamy). 28 - 05 - 2017 Mr.Arnab Gowswamy, I am writing this open letter regarding the show on 26.05 .2017 at 10 PM in which I too was a participant.During the course of that show you arrogantly told me “I have handled bigger leaders than you”.Perhaps that was the only truth you said in that entire show.This one sentence alone is enough to show your ego, arrogance and pettiness.I have never claimed that I am a big leader.Just as you have handled much bigger leaders than me, I have had the privilege of talking to anchors who are honest, gentle, decent, civilized and knowledgeable than you.You have every right to imagine that you have a larger than life image.But my impression about you is that you are not only biased and prejudiced but also that you lack substance, integrity, credibility and even confidence as a journalist.I am sure that you are well aware of your weaknesses and I have always felt that the screams and outbursts you often make are your frustrated attempts to cover up the confidence deficit. You are the most unethical journalist I have ever seen.On 26.05 .2017 I got a call from your channel requesting my time for a debate(!) “On Three Years of Modi Government” between 10 to 10.15PM.When I reached Asianet (with whom you have a tie up) studio as directed by your person by around 9.50 I saw Mr.Ravi Shankar Prasad on screen and came to know that the discussion on Modi Government was about to conclude.Then I immediately asked the Asianet employees in Palakkad Studio to reconfirm the topic for which I had been invited.Aravind, an Asianet employee contacted your channel in my presence and reconfirmed the topic as ‘3 Years of Modi Government’.Then suddenly I came to know on air that you have changed the topic to the alleged “Kodiyeri’s Speech Against Army”.I could have boycotted the show at that moment but I chose to remain because in my absence you may repeatedly scream the lie that I ran away from the show.I wanted to avoid such a situation and tried to present my views on the fabricated story. Whatever little time I got in between your uncivilized outbursts I repeatedly countered your biased statements that Com.Kodiyeri insulted Indian Army.I said that not a single TV Channel in Kerala including your own Asianet have taken this up as a topic of debate and this was not at all controversy in Kerala because everybody knew that his comments were only against the atrocities committed in the name of AFSPA and not against the army.Still you continued your accusations against the CPI(M) as part of your prepared screenplay.I drew your attention to the Supreme Court Order on 27.04 .2016 to investigate all the 1528 murders in Manipur done by security forces under the AFSPA.You ignored that inconvenient fact, probably because you might not have keenly observed such issues related to AFSPA.(After all the sort of journalism, anchoring in your case, which depends more on the ability to make as much noise as possible does not require careful reading, updation, thorough knowledge of the topic and keen observation.People like you can survive with your voice alone and without your brain.) Then you, like a coward, safely surrounded by a Sangh brigade continued spitting venomous lies against CPI(M) without even giving me an opportunity to intervene.Despite my repeated statements that we have never insulted the Indian Army you deliberately put the subtitle “Against Army” with my picture on the screen.This can only be seen as the dirty act of a loyal servant to appease your immediate boss Rajeev Chandrasekhar and your ultimate masters the Sangh Parivar. It was evident from your substandard and abusive remarks against the CPI(M) that your sense of history is poorer than that of a primary school child.Your teacher of history in school would have been much ashamed to see the shameless and naive expression of your ignorance on history.If you wish to learn the role of the communists in the Indian freedom struggle, I can suggest some pamphlets used for beginners because you may not be able to digest any serious work of history.When I told you that it is not the communists but VD Savarkar who betrayed the freedom struggle by sending repeated clemency petitions to the British Government it appeared as if you were hearing about it for the first time in your life.I can send the copies of those clemency petitions for your kind perusal so that the next time you can be better prepared to defend your ‘patriotic’ Hindutva masters.You can also think of arranging a tuition to help you in acquiring some basic facts about our history. Any way, if you work hard to overcome your deficiencies you may be able to improve your understanding of various topics to some extent.But I am not sure, whether at this age you will be able to develop the basic norms of conduct, culture and civilized behavior.Many of these qualities owe much to the manner in which we were brought up in our childhood. Here I must tell you that to me, the army is not simply a newsroom experience.I was born in a military hospital and my entire childhood was spent in anarmy environment.Arnab, I am the proud son of a father who served in the Indian army for long years.He fought in the 1971 war as well.As the ward of a veteran, I’ve also partaken in the sacrificial living of an army family, like several others.Now, tell me, apart from your highly hypocritic and extremely dramatic expressions in the name of army, only to raise ratings, what have you genuinely done for our army? My last piece of suggestion to you, the self proclaimed ambassador of the army, is to find time to watch the recording of your “performances” at least once. Then you will realise how disgusting it is and will definitely search for some other career options.Till you find time to do that we will have no other option but to bear with the high levels of pollution created by your senseless utterances. I dare to write this to you because neither am I a big leader as you rightly said, nor do I wish to become one.My best wishes and regards'

In the latest foot-in-mouth by the veteran screamer and self-righteous Mr. Goswami’s channel is the usage of the visuals of pro-students democratic posters as background for running it’s news story against the emergence of pro-ISIS and pro-maoist posters in University of Delhi.The posters in question used as visuals by Republic TV are from Disha Student Organization. Simran, a student activist with Disha Student Organization said “We had posted the posters to welcome the new comers into Delhi University, who are coming to attend the open days organized by Delhi University. The subject matter of the poster in no way encourages, endorses or advertises any terrorist organization or ideology. The posters are in keeping with the legacy of Bhagat Singh. However exhibiting total callousness Republic TV has used the visuals of our posters to run their story”. She further added that their organization has issued an official statement seeking apology from Republic TV, in case the channel does not run an apology they will go ahead to file a demafation suit against Republic TV.On 28th May 2017, Sunday Republic TV ran a story about pro-ISIS and pro-maoist slogans and wall writing appearing in Delhi University. While running the story Republic TV has very irresponsibly used the visuals of posters by Disha Students organization in the backdrop. As the anchor goes on stating the event close-ups of pro-students posters bearing Bhagat Singh’s picture are pasted onto the screen as pro-ISIS and pro-maoist!! The slogans can be read in the picture given below. The posters mention the slogans such as:1. शिक्षा है सबका अधिकार, बन्द करो इसका व्यापार! (Everyone has the right to Education, Stop it’s commercialization) 2. भगत सिंह के सपनों को साकार करो! ( Come forward to realize Bhagat Singh’s dreams) 3. Dare to fight, dare to win! 4. Flee not, Change the world. 5. लड़ो पढ़ाई करने को, पढ़ो समाज बदलने को। (Fight for education, educate to galvanize change in society) Any sane minded person can decide for themselves what these posters endorse. Delhi University has been a boiling pot of saffron agenda where in January the incident at Ramjas College further sharpened the tensions between pro-students organization and the saffron brigade. The university is being turned into a ghetto where there is no space for any democratic discourse or dissent. Even putting up pro-students democratic posters is being termed as a pro-ISIS act. It appears as if the story has been colored to further the divisive politics of BJP and other parties doing politics on fascist communal lines. The manner in which this story has been run devoid of any facts devoid of any evidence just stating the side of the saffron brigade makes it’s credentials even more questionable. Ever since the Occupy UGC movement and the FTII movement the authorities have further shrunk the space for any democratic activity. Even organizing a study circle calls upon interrogation not just from the authorities but also from Police. The very essence of university and learning is being injected with the poison of saffronization and communal politics.Republic TV has very proudly urges it’s viewers to join the revolution however due to their habit of selective filtering and omission of facts they have slyly refrained from fixing the prefix ‘saffron’. These kinds of acts of irresponsible journalism are not new for Mr Goswami, his past is filled with such acts of unethical journalism be it the case of FTII students movement or the event of 9th February in JNU. Now the saffron brigade has its eyes on DU and hence non-issues are being coloured saffron and being packaged in his trade mark jingoistic nationalistic rhetoric to feed the fire of hatred.'

But since most people have little time and less patience for the point by point refutation below, let me state the main issue simply and concisely. This is not a debate over whose politics or ideology is better, Asst Prof Jangam’s or mine. He believes that he should stop those whose views he disagrees with from undertaking legitimate and invited activities at Carleton University. It is this attitude that I totally disagree with; far from being a champion and defender he is an intolerant opponent of liberalism and freedom of expression. In this particular case, he actually succeeded in his design. The recording to which I was invited was cancelled.Now to a more detailed rejoinder.Part I: Facts1. Asst. Prof. Jangam accuses me of the “secretive use” of the campus of Carleton University. But earlier in the same paragraph, speaking of my travels, he observes: “He has been on an overseas tour on the invitation of the organisation ‘Indic Book Club’ and has been publicising his talks regularly on Twitter. On May 2, 2017, he tweeted ‘Next stop: Carleton U, with Dr. Harsha Dehejia (with a picture of Dehejia), speaking on ‘Drishti: Is there an Indian Way of Seeing,’ to be recorded for CU TV.” How is my Carlton visit “secretive” if I publically announced it? In this regard, Dr. Dehejia reiterated to me in his email received on 12 May 2017: “Your event was not at all secretive. It was cleared by Prof. Shane Hawkins, Chair of the College of the Humanities. … Over the last 15 years, I have made about 10 video conversations with visiting artists and academics all of which I regularly use in my course RELI2515. This enriches my course and sometimes gives a different point of view.”2. The above verifiable email puts paid to Asst Prof Jangam’s claim that I did not have “an official invitation from Carleton.” On the contrary, I was not only officially invited by Adjunct Professor Dr. Harsha V. Dehejia, but confirmed in an to Ms. Judy Donaldson, College Administrator, College of Humanities, Carleton University, my acceptance of the invitation and my permission to be recorded. I was also offered a modest honorarium from Carleton University for this recording. The prerequisite of any such payment has to be an official invitation, with a paper/email trail to prove it. Needless to say, after Asst Prof Jangam’s crusade scuppered the recording at the Media Centre, I declined and returned the payment. Therefore, at Asst Prof Jangam’s instigation, not only was an official programme, with an official invitation, cancelled, but such a cancellation also resulted in financial loss to me. Asst Prof Jangam not only tarnished my reputation, but caused me a quantifiable financial loss.3. Asst Prof Jangam claims that I used Carleton “campus name and legitimacy” to promote the “recording as an achievement” of my “political campaigns on social media.” Wrong: I neither seek Carleton’s name nor legitimacy—my work speaks for itself. But isn’t it also possible that Carleton gains by visits by internationally published and known academics like me? As to seeking “legitimacy” for my “political campaigns on social media,” the charge is uninformed, if not unintelligent. I am an academic, not a politician; I entered the social media space quite recently not to conduct political campaigns but to publish information about my popular writings, especially columns in newspapers and periodicals. In the process, I have also posted brief comments and formulations, which may easily be misread, as often happens on SM. But I have invariably refrained from any hurtful or inflammatory posturing. In contrast, in the few tweets of Asst Prof Jangam that I have I encountered, he has already called me “liar” and other unsavoury epithets several times. In addition, I have posted originally composed haikus, because the 140-character medium is eminently suitable for such sharing. In my self-description, I also declare that I “not merely a political animal.” My point is that SM, especially Twitter, cannot be the sole means to “judge,” “brand,” and “condemn” a person’s politics, as Asst Prof Jangam seems to do, let alone declare him persona non grata on a campus.4. Asst Prof Jangam claims that I do not “stand for the Canadian values.” This accusation seems contra-factual given that I’ve had several multiple-entry visa and have been invited to several Canadian universities. I’ve was invited to Carleton itself way back in 2002, long before Asst Prof Jangam’s hire. I have spoken on numerous occasions, participated in several academic activities, and given lectures in scheduled classes, and recorded several programmes for Carlton University TV. Some of the latter have been used by several batches of students of the introductory Hinduism and other India-related courses, plus members of the public. Not one person has found anything objectionable, let alone clashing with “Carleton values.” What makes Asst Prof Jangam pontificate or adjudicate on said values or stigmatise even ban those who don’t conform to his way of thinking?5. Asst Prof Jangam avers: “At no point did I ask him to cancel the recording.” After I read this denial, I emailed Dr. Dehejia. May I be permitted to quote him verbatim: “I decided not to go ahead with the video conversation with you only when he [Asst Prof Jangam] said, ‘I do not want this event to go through. Prof. Paranjape should not be allowed to use the facilities of Carleton University.’” Asst Prof Jangam adds, “I was not against Paranjape’s visit to campus and if it was an open lecture I myself would have attended and asked questions. But I do not support this secretive claim of legitimacy and would like to register my protest.” I have already established that there was nothing “secretive” about the recording, nor was it a “claim to legitimacy.” But Asst Prof Jangam’s distinction between “secretive” recording and “open lecture” is utterly specious; the two are different, but equally legitimate and “official” activities, serving different functions. The former to be broadcast to students and interested viewers does not require an audience or prior announcements, let alone publicity. That does not somehow make it underhand or sinister. An open lecture, on the other, hand, may be open to all or only to registrants. There might be many other valid and valuable formats too, such as the recording of a lecture before a studio audience, followed by Q&A; an “open” lecture broadcast on FB live, followed by a web Q&A; a live lecture without recording or broadcast; and so on. A rudimentary experience of academic life would obviate an explanation such as this. I suspect that Asst Prof makes inconsequential and irrelevant distinctions between these formats to justify his disruption. More germane to the matter is that he did not “register his protest” as he claims, so much as stop the recording. If he had wanted to, he could have conveyed his objections, then left; instead, from what I have gathered, he insisted that the programme not go through as planned.6. According to Asst Prof Jangam, I have “been writing against the affirmative action for Dalits (untouchables in India).” False again. I am not anti-Dalit, let alone being anti-reservations, but I believe that they should not be based solely on caste. Economic criteria should also be applied. I have often asked reservation activists: won’t caste-based reservations reinforce rather than annihilate caste? How long should caste-based reservation continue? Won’t caste-based quotas end up in an even more rigid caste system? Frankly, I have not found satisfactory answers to such questions. Before going to the next point, I also want very strongly to object to his use of the phrase “untouchables in India”; he should know that untouchability has been outlawed in India since our independence.7. Asst Prof Jangam accuses me of the “endorsement of anti-Muslim … ideas and violence.” False again. Once again, let me state my position. I oppose violence in the name of any religion, in addition to theologically sanctioned terrorism, vandalism, conversion, and hatred. That is why I have argued that modern-day Muslims, especially those professing to be liberal and democratic, ought to condemn such acts more vocally. There are several such hate-mongers in our midst today in India. This is an example of what I oppose: the lynching of Mohammad Hussain in Bengaluru for being a BJP worker. Or this diktat by radical Muslim organisation Hizbul Mujahideen. Does Asst Prof Jangam support such hatred and violence in the name of Islam? How can its condemnation make one “anti-Muslim”? Just to be additionally sure that Asst. Prof. Jangam understands, I also deplore “cow-vigilantes” and the violence of the Hindu right.8. I would not like to engage with Asst. Prof. Jangam on his “casteist” slurs on the Overseas Friends of India, who at very short notice organised an alternate event. But I very strongly object to the falsehood that Dr. Dehejia “went ahead to hastily organise a talk by Dr. Paranjape in a restaurant following this incident,” which “also demonstrates dishonesty.” I would like to state quite categorically that Dr. Dehejia had nothing to do with the alternate event; he merely attended it. In fact, when invited to say a few words at the end, he politely declined and sat down. That event was solely the responsibility of the Overseas Friends of India, who put out the press release too.I am sure Dr. Dehejia, one of the most respected members of the Indian community in Ottawa, does not need my defence. He is one of the most admired physicians and allergists in Ottawa, with a successful practice stretching over fifty years. He has served the community in multiple ways, including offering free medical consultation to the Indian High Commission in Ottawa. He has helped and healed thousands during his long and illustrious career. He is also an eminent Indologist and writer, having earned a PhD from the Anantacharya Institute of Indological Studies, Mumbai University, in addition to his MD. As Adjunct Faculty in Humanities at Carleton, he has taught a popular and successful introductory course in Hinduism for years without taking a single penny from the university. In fact, he has created a Dehejia Hindu Fund primarily with his own money to sponsor or assist important Indian public figures, academics, creative artists, and eminent persons of all ideological hues and dispositions. I personally know that his list of invitees in recent years includes many who cannot, even by a severe stretch, be labelled as Right Wing: for instance, Geeti Sen, Devdutt Patnaik, Ashok Vajpayi. He must apologise for calling Dr. Dehejia dishonest.9. Asst Prof Jangam says, “It is no wonder that he has been chosen to lead the Institute of Advanced Studies in Shimla, a plum post as Dr. Dehejia reminded me on May 3. Please see this article on how he was also shortlisted … as a potential VC of Nalanda University last year.” I have never claimed that I have been “chosen,” even shortlisted, “to lead” IIAS, Shimla; perhaps, Asst Prof Jangam is relying on newspaper leaks, rumours, or Dr. Dehejia’s own kindly, if hopeful, wish. Someone else has been appointed Vice-Chancellor of Nalanda University; re: IIAS Shimla, like anyone else, I cannot say what the outcome might be. But the important thing to note is that such shortlisting or being tipped for higher administrative positions is not new; even under the previous UPA regimes, my name made the rounds, even reached the final stages of the selection process for one or two key appointments. Doesn’t this suggest the opposite of Asst Prof Jangam’s insinuation—the consideration of my candidature is not because of ideological affiliation but in spite of it? Please, Asst Prof Jangam, this spat is not about credentialism vs. favouritism, but freedom vs. intolerance on campuses; do not try to obfuscate the issue.10. My last point in the “facts” part of my response is Asst Prof Jangam’s assertion that I have “aligned” myself “more openly than ever before … with the RSS.” For those who do not know it, the RSS or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, is perhaps the largest socio-cultural organisation in the world, with multiple sub- and sister bodies. Much has been researched and written on it; indeed, this is not the place to determine what it stands for or what its true character is. Let me unequivocally state that I am not a member of the RSS, but I do not agree with Asst Prof Jangam’s slur that it represents “regressive, undemocratic, non-secular values … against the basic Canadian values of equality, secularism, and humanism.” I am nobody to defend the RSS, which has attained greatness, influence, and power because hundreds of thousands of selfless volunteers and patriots have devoted decades in the service of the nation under its aegis. If it is a crime to move closer to the RSS, then let me plead “guilty.” Let me tell Asst Prof Jangam and my other detractors why this has happened. I have been sick and tired of the divisive and infructuous politics of Left vs Right, Hindu vs Muslim, Sikh vs Hindu, Dalit vs Upper Caste, secular vs Hindu, woman vs man, North Indian vs South Indian, “Aryan” vs “Dravidian,” Khalistani vs Indian, and so on; it nauseates me by its hypocrisy and lack of integrity. I support the RSS because it is perhaps the only organisation in the present scenario which avers, “We are one, regardless of caste or creed: we are all Indian, all Bharatiya.” I like this message of the RSS. I intend to continue to support it until I know otherwise.Part II: PrinciplesI had ten factual disputations with Asst Prof Jangam, but when it comes to principles, I have only one. The fundamental principle on which I disagree with Asst Prof Jangam is his belief that he can arbitrate for everyone else what Canadian values are, what Carleton stands for or, for that matter, who should or should not be allowed on his campus. Furthermore, he refuses to discuss, debate, dissent but tries to, in this case, succeeds in, shutting down what other people are doing. I would submit that such matters are open to varied interpretations and must be worked out carefully, with room for differing views. In this case, my recording on “Drishti: Is There an Indian Way of Seeing?” had nothing to do with his work, his field of advertised expertise or, for that matter, his politics, which centres on caste. Yet, because he detests some of my purported beliefs or alleged ideological leanings, he had the temerity to interfere, disrupt, and shut down an official Carleton event. Asst Prof Jangam needs to learn that that is not what Canadian, Carleton, or indeed, democratic values in free societies all over the world, stand for.Last year, when he listened to my invited Gandhi talk in one of the Carleton courses and joined me for lunch, I told him how proud I was of him and his achievements, especially since he studied at two institutions, University of Hyderabad, where I taught, and JNU, where I have been Professor for nearly seventeen years. After his attack on me, I decided to take a closer look at his work. I am afraid that I am constrained to revise my view of him. I find that he comes across primarily as a polemicist and crusader, internationally “caste-lashing” India, indulging in rampant name-calling, fact-twisting, and “Hindu bashing.” If I may address him directly through this forum, I would tell him, “Sir, there is much more to academics than invective, slating, and ranting. Indeed, mere philippic does not a scholar make. Name-calling, distortion of truth, quoting out of context, making irrelevant and unsubstantiated allegations and, ultimately, using all these to justify the unjustifiable, in this case, your assault on the freedom of expression on an internationally renowned university of which you have the privilege to be a member, does not behoove you, the institutions that trained you, or the country and culture that you come from.”ConclusionFrom all the evidence at hand, it is fairly obvious that Asst Prof Jangam disrupted and stopped an official programme at Carleton because he was opposed to the alleged ideology of one of the participants. A simple test of this hypothesis is to raise the contra-factual possibility of what might have happened if he had not intervened? Wouldn’t any sensible person agree that the recording would have gone ahead as scheduled? If the only reason it was cancelled was his presence and protest, accompanied by real or veiled threats, how can he evade responsibility? How can he try to shift the blame onto someone or something else? What is more, his statements clearly indicate his intentions, even if he does not own up their outcomes. He definitely intended to stop the programme; no, not just that, he believed and still does that both his actions and intentions are justified.May I finally and respectfully point out that we are not debating the content of our respective ideologies, beliefs, or political positions. What we are debating is whether Asst Prof Jangam had the right to disrupt, shut down, or stymie those he disagrees with or whose positions he dislikes. Even a modicum of understanding of liberal values would clarify that they imply multiple, even contrary points of views, not for one person’s dogmatic opposition to someone else’s view to push the latter out of the public space. While Asst Prof Jangam has every right to adhere, even espouse, what he believes, he cannot decide for the University, for Canada, or for India what liberal values are or what is “not good for any society.” He certainly does not have the right to stop others from doing what they believe in on the basis of the certainty of his convictions. That is why I used the word “bullying” to describe his conduct; I could have used worse. Because, frankly, his mode of functioning is the very antithesis of what liberal academics is. Armed with some belligerent notion of political correctness or the other, he, and many others all over the world, strut about and stalk our campuses, scaring opponents into submission or silence. They may consider themselves intellectual “activists,” but some of their actions better fit the epithet “intellectual terrorists.” I have not—and will not—characterize Asst Prof Jangam thus, but I will call out his aggressive and intimidating tactics against ideological and political opponents. I will also question, critique, and oppose, whenever I must, his hiding behind some pseudo-noble ideal to rationalise wrong-doing. People like Asst Prof Jangam claim to be victims, but come across as aggressors; they speak in the name of liberal values but reveal themselves to be intolerant even to differing, let alone opposing, views.To end, let me quote another social justice activist, also from an underprivileged background, who says in a moving article that “Hinduism and Indian Civilisation belongs to Dalits and ‘lower castes’ as much as it belongs to any other community. In fact, it belongs to us even more. If you erase Indian civilisation and Hinduism, you erase us too”— what a clear and straightforward message, though so contrary to your way of thinking.'

        article_claim = 'Since the last few days, social media has been buzzing with the news of Dr. Makarand Paranjape, author and Professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University being stopped from attending a video recording at Carleton University in Canada by Dr. Chinnaiah Jangam, Assistant Professor at the university. The news was originally carried as a Press Release by Overseas Friends Of India, Canada. A Twitter account in the name of OFI, Canada was created in May and this Press Release and Prof Paranjape’s talk were tweeted from this account. Dr. Paranjape also wrote an open letter to the President and Vice-Chancellor of the Carleton University about the incident. The news of Dr Paranjape’s recording being cancelled at the last minute “at the instigation of Assistant Professor Chinnaiah Jangam who aggressively bullied the university authorities” was also carried in Swarajya magazine.'
        textcontent = '“I found his letter (to the president) as well as the statement released by ‘Overseas Friends of India’ completely untrue and misrepresentative of what actually happened”, said Dr Jangam in an email to Alt News. “Since the last couple of days, Dr Paranjape and the belligerent Hindu right-wing websites have been carrying out a malicious campaign against me. I was contacted by many people to put forward my side of the story. I have written down what exactly happened that day and also the reasons behind my concerns about Dr Paranjape”, said Dr Jangam.The full text of Dr Jangam’s response is reproduced below. Are you Stating Facts, Dr. Makarand Paranjape? Chinnaiah Jangam, Department of History. Carleton University Ottawa, Canada. Swarajya: Read India Right, a Hindu right-wing news website, published a statement issued by an Ottawa based organization Overseas Friends of India (Canada) accusing me of “stopping” Dr. Makarand Paranjape from recording and “browbeat[ing] Carleton University to cancel the event.” It might be noted that the twitter account of this organization Overseas Friends of India (Canada) was launched on May 6, 2017, seemingly with the intention of publishing this statement and publicize this issue. Dr. Paranjape also wrote an open letter to Carleton University president, Dr. Roseann Runte complaining against me and claiming that he and his host, Dr. Harsha Dehejia, a medical doctor and an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Religion at Carleton University, were bullied by me. First, let me make it clear that I did not even have a word with Dr. Paranjape and his accusation of bullying is a complete lie. Here are the facts that I would like to elaborate not only to correct the false accusations against me, but also to expose his dishonesty.Dr. Paranjape tweets every day about his tours, writings and lectures. He has been on an overseas tour on the invitation of the organization “Indic Book Club” and has been publicizing his talks regularly on Twitter. On May 2, 2017, he tweeted “Next stop: Carleton U, with Dr. Harsha Dehejia (with a picture of Dehejia), speaking on “Drishti: Is there an Indian Way of Seeing,” to be recorded for CU TV.” This recording was nowhere announced officially on Carleton University website and I called Carleton University Television Studio (Media Production Centre) officials on May 3, morning to find out about it. The Supervisor, Lisa Lunge-Faubert confirmed that the recording was scheduled for 1:30 pm on the same day. I asked her whether she knows anything about the guest who would come to the studio. She said the host Dr. Dehejia did not even give the name of the person he was bringing in, and she had no information about him, nor of the course for which the recording was to take place. I told her that it was Dr. Paranjape from India and he had already tweeted about the scheduled recording. Lisa was surprised to hear that the information about the recording being tweeted as it was not a public event, nor was it an official invitation from Carleton as the tweet seemed to suggest. I also informed her that Paranjape is a controversial Hindu right ideologue who uses his academic affiliations and institutional relations to promote Hindu right ideology. I told her I was a faculty member in the Department of History and teach Indian history and that I follow the developments in India keenly. I informed her that the invited guest to the studio does not stand for the Canadian values especially Carleton’s values of inclusiveness, tolerance and diversity. Moreover, I also said that if it was an openly publicized talk, I would not have any concerns, and would have publicly brought forth my objections (as was done during the talks he had given in the UK and US in the past several days). But as a faculty in the institution, I do not support the secretive use of our campus name and legitimacy to promote this recording as an achievement of his political campaigns on social media.Lisa wanted evidence to substantiate my claims and I took print-outs of the tweets and writings of Dr. Paranjape and showed her. Lisa was disturbed with the revelations and took me to her director. I again explained my position to him too. However, they both told me they cannot cancel the recording. I told them that it was not my intention to cancel either but I was there to inform them about the speaker and to voice my concerns about the speaker and the nature of the event. They told me that I should speak to the host Dr. Dehejia. They asked me to wait and speak to him directly.As I was still in conversation with Lisa and the director, Dr. Dehejia, along with his wife and Dr. Paranjape arrived. The studio administrator Lisa took me to Dr. Dehejia and I greeted him. Lisa told Dr. Dehejia that I have some concerns about the invited guest. She took me and Dr. Dehejia to a board room. We sat together and I calmly explained to Dr. Dehejia about the politics and writings of Dr. Paranjape in the last one year and showed him his tweets and writings. Dr. Dehejia expressed ignorance about the politics of Paranjape and he questioned me in what capacity I was speaking to him? I told I was there as a colleague and as a specialist on Indian history. I explained to him how the Hindu right majoritarian supremacist politics in India was fomenting violence against Muslims and Dalits. I also reminded him that Canada and Carleton University do not stand for the kind of divisive politics espoused by RSS and we should not provide any semblance of legitimacy to them as responsible academics.Dr. Dehejia said Dr. Paranjape is a well-known academic and published extensively and he would become the director of Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla soon. I agreed that he is an academic who has published extensively — I do not dispute it. However, the politics he espouses and endorses now are not good for any society. Especially, in the last one year Dr. Paranjape has been writing against the affirmative action for Dalits (untouchables in India) and his open espousal of RSS ideology and his endorsement of anti-Muslim and anti-Dalit ideas and violence were serious concerns for me (See the link below to the recent indictment of Indian government by UN Human Rights Panel). I told him I was not against Paranjape’s visit to campus and if it was an open lecture I myself would have attended and asked questions. But I do not support this secretive claim of legitimacy and would like to register my protest.At no point did I ask him to cancel the recording. Dr. Dehejia himself said that “[he] was in a fix and he did not know how to convey this message to Dr. Paranjape” He asked me if he could tell Dr. Paranjape that the event was cancelled because of my objections. I told him that I did not ask to cancel the event but I did have objections against the misuse of the Carleton’s name and academic legitimacy. Only when he asked me what I would do in his situation, I said that if I were in his situation, I would cancel it. However, most importantly, I also told him if he wanted to record Dr. Paranjape despite my concerns, he should go ahead – it was not in my position to stop him. At that point, Dr. Dehejia said “as a member of Carleton University, [he] stands by the values of liberal and tolerant society”, and would go and convey this to Dr. Paranjape. Throughout the conversation, Lisa was present. In the end, we shook hands and left. Therefore, the allegations of brow-beating, hurling abuses, and forcibly stopping Dr. Paranjape from recording, are all lies.The statement of Overseas Friends of India, and Dr. Paranjape’s assertion (in his open letter and again in his incessant twitter posts) that he and his host were bullied, is part of a malicious campaign against me with manufactured lies. (The fact that Dr. Dehejia, after claiming to stand by the liberal and tolerant values, in front of me and the recording studio official, went ahead to hastily organize a talk by Dr. Paranjape in a restaurant following this incident, also demonstrates dishonesty.)While I am very familiar with the false Hindu right propaganda, I did not expect a university professor who claims to be an intellectual, to be so dishonest even in a foreign land. I demand Dr. Paranjape to tender an unconditional apology for the lies and distortion of facts, as well as for instigating other fellow right-wingers to publish unsubstantiated, slanderous articles about me in rightist websites – articles that Dr. Paranjape is re-tweeting and spreading around.Also see below a paragraph elaborating my concerns (with evidences) about Dr. Paranjape’s alignment with organizational values that foment violence, hatred and divisiveness. These values are contrary to any institution which stands for liberal values and strives for a tolerant and diverse society without any discrimination based on race, religion, caste, gender and ideological preferences.The Overseas Friends of India represents privileged upper-caste Hindus (note that their twitter page — https://twitter.com/oficanada — cover photo is that of a Hindu temple as they are part of the current majoritarian politics that conflates Indian identity with majoritarian Hindu identity, thereby marginalizing the Muslims, lower castes, and other minority communities) who benefit from Canadian values of liberalism and diversity but openly back Hindu fundamentalist organizations in India claiming to represent their culture and civilization. My Concerns about Dr. Paranjape. It is true that I am acquainted with Dr. Paranjape’s prolific writings and scholarship and briefly interacted with him when he was in Carleton in 2015, even if we do not agree on several fronts.However, since the last one year or so, he has aligned himself more openly than ever before, with the Hindu nationalist right-wing politics in India, especially with the RSS. He is seen as one of their primarily intellectual spokespersons and has publicly articulated against Muslims, against affirmative action for Dalits, against student resistance (including in the institution he teaches in, JNU, which also happens to be my alma mater). He has been an apologist for right-wing politicians and spokesperson of the government which has been violating human rights with impunity in the past few years. Find here news on the UNHCR report from last week. It is no wonder that he has been chosen to lead the Institute of Advanced Studies in Shimla, a plum post as Dr. Dehejia reminded me on May 3. Please see this article on how he was also shortlisted, among few other RSS-backed candidates, as a potential VC of Nalanda University last year. Also this article from last month about his participation in a closed-door RSS seminar, attended by none other than the RSS supremo Mohan Bhagwat, underlines his proximity to the offices of highest power within the far-right RSS.In this article Paranjape denounces secularism, says India is ‘not a secular country’ (which is unconstitutional!) and calls for taking India back to its ‘moorings after a secular interlude’! Even in his book The Afterlife of Gandhi on the assassination of Gandhi by an RSS activist, he says the accusation towards the RSS is ‘best described as political’ and in his discussion on medieval Indian history Paranjape says, ‘Muslims should realise and admit the wrongs perpetrated under the Islamic rule.” He continues, “Nothing of the sort has, of course happened. There is no Indian equivalent of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, which helped to heal the wounds of apartheid after the collapse of the latter. Such a process has never happened between Hindus and Muslims in India.”With the political power in the hands of BJP in the centre along with several key states in India, the RSS, its ideological mentor, is playing an unprecedentedly decisive role in governance and social policies. From cow vigilantism to demonization of and violence against Muslims and Dalits, they have been undermining the secular traditions of India and conflating Indian nationalism with a dangerous version of majoritarian Hindu politics.Their regressive ideas about society and social engineering that is persisting even today is also apparent in this recent issue. Please also see this article which exposes the right-wing priest-politician and his views on Christians and women — a politician who Dr. Paranjape praises in the article quoted before.In short, the regressive, undemocratic, non-secular values of the RSS, an organization with which Dr. Paranjape has clearly aligned himself, are against the basic Canadian values of equality, secularism, and humanism. It is with that conviction I went to ask Dr. Dehejia before the recording, if he was acquainted with Dr. Paranjape’s recent political leanings, and to register my objections — not with the objective of stifling his voice.'

The group has everyone from State BJP President Kummanam Rajasekharan to channel studio sanghi Rahul Easwar, “independent” dalit activist Dhanya Raman, popular online sanghi Lekshmi Kanath and musician Njeralath Harigovindan, who has even taken part in a meet against fascism last year.'
        textcontent = 'The secret group, from the conversations, has been formed to alert about “love jihad incidents” (read – inter-religious marriages) happening in kerala and to take steps to prevent it. One message in the group posted on January 8, for instance, says – “Two Muslim youths have started their journey with two beautiful Hindu girls from Thalassery to Bangalore in the 9.30 p.m. bus. There were a group of bearded men to see them off. On seeing us Swayamsevaks with rakhis on our wrist, they quickly left the area” The details of the bus, including number, colour and travels name is also shared, asking the Swayamsevaks in bangalore to “take action”.Dalit activist Dhanya Raman, is seen giving “thumbs up” to a suggestion that the group should be used only for the purpose of Love Jihad propaganda.The chats also reveal infighting between the various sangh activists. One Mr.Jayakanthan is criticised for his facebook posts criticising Modi for his favours to corporates like Ambani and Adani. There are also discussions on how some mad RSS men are giving all of them a bad image by their actions. They also discuss about “moles” in the group and on the need for an even more secretive group for confidential discussions. Another discussion is on an online campaign to create a propaganda that the sanghis are being hounded by the left in Kerala.The point is, this is just one group for a single purpose- Love Jihad propaganda. The sangh is running hundreds of such groups to co-ordinate their activities to spread hatred in Kerala. What we have not seen is even worse!(Many of the dialogues are in English.

She just talks about death threats against her and news items published to tarnish her image.However, soon after she put up this post, her lies were exposed in the comments section, when people put up screenshots of the list of members of the Love Jihad group. It clearly showed that dhanya.raman was a member of the group. This is a unique name code which no one else shares. Also, there is no fake account of Dhanya raman in facebook with the same profile picture.The fact that these screenshots were genuine, were confirmed by Rahul Easwar in a facebook post  , which asked readers to see how all his comments in the group were moderate, and not communal in nature. So, it is confirmed that such a group exists and these people were part of it.'

The screenshot below captures the change in India Today’s report, left one has been taken from the archived version, right is the present version.A report in Hindustan Times dated May 2nd now suggests that the retaliation never happened and that the TV channels went ballistic without confirmation. Following statement was given by a senior officer with the army’s northern command to Hindustan Times:There was no retaliation whatsoever by us in the KG sector on Monday night. They (TV channels) go ballistic without asking us anything. We will retaliate and when we do, we will come out with an official statement.However, it was not just the TV channels that went ballistic. Even official spokesperson of the ruling Government started quoting this story of retaliation. In a panel discussion on Aaj Tak in which Paramajit Kaur, wife of Naib Subedar Paramjit Singh, was present, BJP Spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed that Indian Army has destroyed 2 Pakistani posts and killed 7 Pakistani soldiers. He stated this around 1:00 minute into the video below.If the Hindustan Times report claiming that there was no retaliation by Army is indeed true, that would mean that BJP spokesperson was lying to a martyr’s wife on live television. Sambit Patra repeated the claim in another show with Aajtak anchor Anjana Om Kashyap. At 40 seconds into the video below, Sambit Patra repeats the claim about 2 Pakistani bunkers being destroyed.Besides Aaj Tak, the other channels that made elaborate reports on this issue of retaliation by Indian Army are Aajtak’s sister concern India Today, Zee News, ABP News and India TV.Screenshot of India Today\'s report on retaliation by Indian ArmyScreenshot of ABP News report on retaliation by Indian Army.Screenshot of Zee News report on retaliation by Indian ArmyScreenshot of India TV report on retaliation by Indian Army.In print media, Dainik Jagran, who had recently published an illegal exit poll during UP elections, carried this story on their front page.

This follow-up 9-minute report by Aaj Tak on this issue dated May 2nd talks about Army vowing to retaliate but does not once mention their own claims about Army already having retaliated.

The quotes also made it to mailing lists and one such copy dated 29th March 2017 is available here => bit.ly/2nyMS6t. '
        textcontent = 'A verbatim copy of the 9 quotes is as follows: Have you ever read these Western philosophers 1. Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) “Hindus and Hindutva will one day rule the world, because this is a combination of knowledge and wisdom”. 2. Herbert Wells (1846 – 1946): “Until the effectiveness of Hindutva is restored, how many generations will suffer atrocities and life will be cut off, then one day the entire world will be attracted to it, on that day there will be Dilshad and on that day the world will be inhabited. 3. Albert Einstein (1879-1955): “I understand that through his intelligence and awareness he did that which the Jews could not do. In Hinduism it is the power that can lead to peace.” 4. Huston Smith (1919): “The faith which is upon us and this is better than us in the world, then it is Hindutva. If we open our hearts and minds for it, then it will be good for us”. 5. Michael Nostradamus (1503 – 1566): “Hindutva will become the ruler religion in Europe, but the famous city of Europe will become the Hindu capital”. 6. Bertrand Russell (1872 – 1970): “I read Hinduism and realized that it is for the religion of all the world and all mankind.” Hindutva will spread throughout Europe and in Europe, big thinkers of Hinduism will emerge. One day it will come that Hindus will be the real stimulus of the world. “. 7. Gosta Lobon (1841 – 1931): “Hindus speak of peace and reconciliation. I invite Christians to appreciate the faith of reform.” 8. Bernard Shaw (1856 – 1950): “The entire world will accept Hindu religion one day and if it can not even accept the real name it will accept it by name only.” West will accept Hindutva one day and Hindu will be the religion of those who have studied in the world “. 9. Johann Geith (1749 – 1832): “We all have to accept Hinduism now or later and this is the real religion. If I say no to Hindu, I will not feel bad, I accept this right thing.” Even before we start exploring whether these quotes are genuine or not, here’s a funny coincidence. The above 9 eminent people also happened to say the same wonderful things about Islam and Islamic Sharia. A Facebook Page called Iqra posted the following Hindi Text in a Facebook Post dated Nov 18, 2015, an english translation of which is available in this forum post dated Dec 19, 2015 => bit.ly/2nOOAmg: क्या आपने इन पश्चिमी philosophers को पढ़ा है: . 1. लियो टॉल्स्टॉय (1828 -1910): “इस्लामी शरीयत ही एक दिन दुनिया पर राज करेगी क्योंकि इसी में ज्ञान और बुद्धि का संयोजन है”। . 2. हर्बर्ट वेल्स (1846 – 1946): “इस्लाम का अनावरण फिर उगता होने तक कितनी पीढ़ियां अत्याचार और बदबख़्ती जीवन कट जाएगा तभी पूरी दुनिया उसकी ओर आकर्षित हो जाएगी और उसी दिन ही दिल शाद होंगे और उसी दिन दुनिया आबाद होगी सलाम हो उस दिन “। . 3. अल्बर्ट आइंस्टीन (1879 – 1955): “मैं समझता हूँ कि मुहम्मद ने अपनी बुद्धि और जागरूकता के माध्यम से वह किया जो यहूदी न कर सके, इस्लाम ही वह शक्ति है जिससे शांति स्थापित हो सकती है”। . 4. हसटन स्मिथ (1919): “जो विश्वास पर हम इससे बेहतर कुछ भी दुनिया में है और वे इस्लाम है अगर हम अपना दिल और दिमाग इसके लिए खोलें तो उसमें हमारी भलाई होगी”। . 5. माइकल नोस्टरीडाम (1503 – 1566): “इस्लाम ही यूरोप में शासक धर्म बन जाएगा बल्कि यूरोप के प्रसिद्ध शहर इस्लाम साइडर राजधानी बन जाएगा”। . 6. बर्टरांड रोसल (1872 – 1970): “मैंने इस्लाम को पढ़ा और जान लिया कि यह सारी दुनिया और सारी मानवता का धर्म बनने के लिए आया है, इस्लाम यूरोप में फैल जाएगा और यूरोप में इस्लाम के बड़े दाई सामने आएंगे एक दिन ऐसा आएगा कि इस्लाम ही दुनिया की वास्तविक उत्तेजना होगा “। . 7. गोस्टा लोबोन (1841 – 1931): “इस्लाम ही सुलह और सुधार की बात करता है सुधार ही विश्वास की सराहना में ईसाइयों को ही आमंत्रित किया हूँ”। . 8.बरनार्डशो (1856 – 1950): “सारी दुनिया एक दिन इस्लाम स्वीकार कर लेगी, अगर यह वास्तविक नाम स्वीकार नहीं भी कर ले रूपक नाम से ही स्वीकार कर लेगी, पश्चिम एक दिन इस्लाम स्वीकार कर लेगा और इस्लाम ही दुनिया में पढ़े लिखे लोगों का धर्म होगा “। . 9. जोहान गीथ (1749 – 1832): “हम सभी को अभी या बाद मे इस्लाम स्वीकार करना होगा यही असली धर्म है, मुझे कोई मुसलमान कहे तो मुझे बुरा नहीं लगेगा, मैं यह सही बात को स्वीकार करता हूँ कि इस्लाम माफ कमजोरी की वजह से नहीं रखता बल्कि मुसलमान अपने धर्म पर भरपूर विश्वास और अपने विश्वास के प्रतिबंध के कारण माफ करते हैं”। 1. Leo Tolstoy (1828 -1910): “Islamic Sharia will one day rule the world because this is the combination of knowledge and wisdom”. . 2. Herbert Wells (1846 – 1946): “Islam Unveiled How many generations until then rises and tortured Bdbkhti life will be cut if the whole world will be attracted to her and would be married on the same day as the heart and saluting the same day will be the day that populate the world” . . 3.

Johann Gith (1749 – 1832): “We all have to accept sooner or later the real religion Islam, a Muslim says to me then I will not mind, I’ll admit it right that Islam sorry because of the weakness but Muslims do not believe in their religion and their faith due to restrictions on the bumper are sorry. If we are to believe the above two passages, that would mean that Leo Tolstoy believes that both Hindutva and Islamic Sharia will one day rule the world. Quite an impossibility. In fact, Leo Tolstoy has authored a book called “What I believe” in 1884 in which he expresses his firm beliefs in Christianity. Thus, he couldn’t have been a proponent of either Hindutva or Islamic Sharia. Moreover, Leo Tolstoy died in 1910 and the word “Hindutva” was popularised by RSS ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in 1923 in a pamphlet titled “Essentials of Hindutva” which Savarkar had written while in imprisonment, a full 13 years after Leo Tolstoy died. The above passages are handiwork of people who want to spread falsehood via whatever social medium they have access to so as to try and further a specific political/religious narrative. While WhatsApp is a powerful medium, please be very circumspect about what you believe.'

When he did not, they allegedly beat up his staff. Kavita Srivastava who is the National Secretary of PUCL (People’s Union for Civil Liberties) was called upon to visit the place.'

All the hoteliers and other private residents throw garbage there. Some of the stray cows who were hanging out near the kachra, (The stray cow population of the city is always hovering near dustbins, as they are very hungry) immediately went for the freshly thrown bags, which had food waste along with some chicken / mutton bones.Kamal Didi immediately started thrashing Qasim that he was trying to pollute the cows with beef and dragged and him and brought him to the hotel, with 15 other of her followers. Very soon, more than a hundred people joined them, all wanting Rabbani to come out. The police was called that beef was being cooked and served in this hotel. The police and the media came together. The Gau Rakshaks are always with the media. When they could not find Rabbani, they picked up Wasim the receptionist and the cleaner and booked them under section 151 CrPC and arrested them. At the hotel, they found brochures on the activities of the SIO (the Jamaat Student wing), writings of Maulana Wahauddin and the communal HARMONY campaign literature of Jamait Islami hind, so the police reached the jamaat office asking for Naeem Rabbani. When they learnt that he was not there, they went to his house and as said by filmstar Ajeet’s in his famous dialogue “uski ma, behen ko utha lao”, they picked up the brother in law Abdul Rehman, who had nothing to do with the hotel. Which is when people got in touch with me.I rushed to the Sindhi camp police station, the police let the brother in law go, it was only on our way out that we learnt that they had picked up two others of the hotel, after dropping Abdul Rehman safely to his relatives, we went back to the police station to meet the other two and get them out. But the police told us that they had been booked and arrested. They would be produced in front of a magistrate and restrained.What is interesting is that the protest over the hoax cry that beef was being cooked, resulted in police taking the meat samples and also the Jaipur Municipal corporation sealing the hotel. They got all the guests out and sealed it. What is sad is that Hyatt Rabbani has been getting awards regularly from the hoteliers association for good service among the other things. Now the hotel is closed. Rabbani is being asked to show up in the morning and will also be restrained under sec 151, Cr PC.The Muslim community leadership is in a state of shock as to how could the police come under pressure and book Rabbani and pick up his staff over just an allegation of beef being cooked and served when it was all false. They are very upset. The electronic media, has kind of declared that the meat samples were of suspicious nature. Did not seem mutton or chicken.Some were also sure that this was done by the next door hotelier who was threatened by their booming business. The ward councillor Nirmala Sharma was also there. Who was directing the JMC staff to seal the hotel. While this was being done, the crowds were shouting Jai Shree Ram. Infact, Jai Shree Ram and other slogans were constantly being raised in the drama which lasted 4 and a half hour. From 6pm to 10.30pmQasim and Wasim are spending the night in the police station, Hopefully should be released tomorrow. Rabbani not knowing what has hit him, he was just working hard and doing business, is now preparing to face the police. His friends and other members of the Muslim community kept saying that all over Jaipur people are throwing garbage as there are not even garbage bins, why take action against us only. When I told this to a senior police official he said we only act somebody complains.This is not the first beef related case in Rajasthan. On 30th May, 2015 in village Birloka, Khimsar Tehsil, Nagaur District 60-year-old Abdul Ghaffar Qureshi was lynched by a mob for no fault of his. Simply because a rumour spread that Muslims had killed more than 200 cows for a feast and pictures of the carcasses started circulating on social media. Young men in thousands gathered in the fields of Kumhari village where the carcasses were lying as the municipality contractor had rented the field to dispose of a cattle carcass, as a routine municipal exercise, hate speeches and protests took off all over and before one knew Abdul Ghaffar Quereshi who had nothing to do with the incident was beaten with iron rods and killed in the market place, despite some of his Hindu neighbours trying to help him. The hate speech had provoked the neighbourhood to just kill the man as there wanted him out of the village.'
